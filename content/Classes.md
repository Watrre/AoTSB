> [!Tip] Mage
> Uses lots of cantrips and other spells with daily limits. A mage caster needs to choose an element to specialize in if they want to become a master. However, a mage can choose to become a jack of all spells and a master of none.

> [!Tip] Assassin
> Uses stealth to scout and possible assassinate targets. They are limited to smaller weapons but are agile. The only spells they have access to are stealth-related

> [!Tip] Martial Artist
> These Knights are like a tank; they use their skills to overpower their enemies using a combo of [[Dexterity]] and [[Strength]]. Their weapons are limited to how they allocate their attributes. The only spells they have access to are self-healing or curing.

> [!Tip] Spellblade
> These knights are adept at using both magic and swordsmanship. A balance between one-handed swordplay and casting magic with their offhand to either buff their sword or cast distractions. The only spells accessible are one-handed spells that can buff your weapon or distract the enemy.
