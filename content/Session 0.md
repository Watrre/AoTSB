00:00:29 [DM]

OK, so our session zero that we're going to do for this is going to be quite short. I'm going to give you guys a brief introduction of the world that I've created for you to have fun and f*** around in, and I'm not going to go too much into detail because a lot of the things you don't know yet because of your backgrounds, because of where you're starting, you will learn a lot more information as the story progresses and as you learn more things and get your footholds in. the world, however, I don't think it's very fun if I give you a... complete cookie cutter definition of what the world is like, I think it's more fun if you could figure it out for yourself and maybe make assumptions that I might not have made and I might not have... calculated into how I wanted this to become because in reality this is our story. You know, it's not mine. It's not one I created. It's one that you guys are exploring and I've basically just set the groundwork, you know, so you guys are free to roam around, do whatever you want.

00:01:29 [DM]

So this story is The Arc of the Spellblade, and for some basics about the world, the world is mostly barren as this story takes place in the after effects of the world being attacked by demons, and the world losing effectively, the hero did not kill the demon Lord. They did not drive the armies back completely. It was not a happy ending...

00:01:52 [DM]

You'll see most campaigns. You'll see most stories. Ohh, this is, 10 years after things succeeded. Well, this this is the story. And when things didn't succeed. Almost everywhere in the world, except for a major guarded city with tons of funding, is not safe. It could be sieged at any time, it could be ransacked, it could even be destroyed by magic from the Demon Army. You- You have no idea. There's no security.

00:02:20 [DM]

So if you really look at the base of the map of the world, you'll see that there are quite. few settlements of humans and you'll see mostly large cities with tall and strong, walls that are heavily guarded, I might add. Heavily guarded in almost all directions. The cities are built as terraces, so there are many- There are many layers to it. The wall layers are lower than, let's say, the palace layer. Meaning that it's quite hard to siege. If you look at different maps in the past of different castles that have stood through thousands of years, you'll see this. You'll see this exact trend. You know, moats work to an extent. Walls work to an extent. But, unless you have the natural barriers, you know you have to build up and you have to build layers and floors.

00:03:19 [DM]

So we're now we'll be getting into the session one before I do that. Does anyone have any questions because that's essentially all the background you get unless you? Have any questions?

00:03:29 [Christian]

So my one question was, you've described the world as barren, barren in what manner?

00:03:35 [DM]

I'm glad you asked... Think of it as not so much of barren as in like nuclear wasteland, or like most of the fertile areas have been destroyed. Think of it as like barren of Civilization, I guess is a good way to put it. You'll see a lot of places that are mostly desolate. You'll see a lot of ruins that are been taken over by nature over the time period. And for a time period's sake, this is about 100 years after the hero did not succeed and humanity is teetering on extinction, there are roughly, as you know of now, only two human settlements that could be called cities or nations.

00:04:20 [DM]

The rest are more. I guess you could call it mercenary nations. They're not really... sufficient on their own means. So outside of that... You'll mostly see a world full of monsters, vegetation growth, more like what you would expect, if the world didn't have humans in it and it was only monsters, does that answer your question?

00:04:48 [Christian]

So like as if it's just like complete wilderness... And like... Sorry, I'm oversimplifying some things here. So yeah, yeah, it makes sense to me.

00:04:57 [DM]

Me. Yep. No, you can oversimplify it. Don't be afraid to ask questions.
I'm happy to answer anything.

00:05:03 [Marthah]

Is it beautiful though? Even though?

00:05:06 [DM]

In some locations it is. It is quite beautiful. In other locations it seems like... Nature has gone... A bit eerily far in taking over the landscape.

00:05:19 [Marthah]

Are there laws? Is are is there like is there a race or something that is kind of fighting for superiority and like ruling?

00:05:35 [DM]

Outside of the two nations that you know of that you could call the two last bastions of humanity outside of their small... Encapsulation. It is lawless. There is no organization that has enough power to enforce laws outside of their means. If there was the one that could, well, there is one that can. However that is the demons and they don't really go by laws. They have laws within their own kind. However, they are by no means... The police of the world.

00:06:24 [DM]

Open to questions.
You guys got plenty of time to ask questions.

00:06:27 [Marthah]

Christian, you had a question?

00:06:29 [Christian]

I was gonna ask like... When like talking about like the the world and like how nature has seemingly like... I forget like what exact words you said. But like, you're really like, overtaken. Like a lot more like you, you should expect. Like before, you said that I was gonna like ask is there like play like some places where Not only is nature like seemingly Overtaking things, than what you should expect, but other places were like... It's anomalous, like it's just not right in the slightest.

00:07:09 [DM]

I did hint to that absolutely when I said that in some places nature has eerily taken over 100%. There are anomalies in our first session. You start in an anomaly. \f\*\*\*, that's a hard word, dude. You know what I mean? You you start there, you know. And there are plenty around.

However, some have been around. For 50 years, maybe even 100 years, some have not. Some are new, some are undocumented. And a lot of these places that you can see and you can venture to. Some of them haven't even been visited within these hundred years because think of it as, like, think of it as a huge map. Where humidity has fled to the farthest point West that they could.

A lot of a lot of them can't afford. They can barely afford to protect themselves. Never mind send scouts or parties to, like, go and explore. You know, they're more worried about survival. So a lot of these places haven't even been visited. And some of them you can argue, are drastically different than what historical documents have of them from 100 years.

00:08:18 [Marthah]

So there are no humans alive that recall life before the takeover by the demons, right?

00:08:26 [DM]

Absolutely correct. The only the only information that stands is of that in libraries.

00:08:34 [Christian]

And even that's limited because we're only two bastions, I assume.

00:08:37 [DM]

Exactly. Even that is limited. Most of them have been destroyed, and most of the information the libraries, most people don't even care about. It seems like fairy tale at this point.


Most people have spent their entire lives living.

Because everyone who went to war who was well able bodied to go to war went to war, the people that didn't were old. \[But the] the young people lived. The old people died. Most people only remember living within the walls or protecting the walls or even venturing between areas.

Like in between the two bastions or two mercenary states. That's about it. It's almost a secluded lifestyle.

00:09:16 [Marthah]

And so the majority of the humans are in those terraced cities.

00:09:21 [DM]

The majority, yes, of course not to say there aren't bandits. There aren't people around. There definitely are. But we're talking like. A rough population. This isn't correct. Numbers don't write this down, future Christian. But let's say, like 5000 people live in one city, the ratio could be like 100 that don't, or 50 that don't.

So yes, the majority do. But there are definitely people that don't live within the cities and live on their own.

00:09:54 [Christian]

That's all the questions I have.

00:09:56 [DM]

Is that all the questions you have, Martha?

00:09:58 [Marthah]

I think so, yeah.

00:09:59 [DM]

Fan-f\*\*\*\*\*\*-tabulous. All right, let's get into session one.

00:10:04 [Marthah]

Yay.
