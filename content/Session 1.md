00:10:06 [DM]

You 2 have decided to join.

00:10:11 [DM]

I'm sorry. I'm dying. You 2 have decided to join a party that is adventuring on the great ravine of the Desolated King.

00:10:15 Speaker 4

It's.

00:10:21 [DM]

The cold winter season has left this ravine nearly submerged, halfway by snow.

00:10:27 [DM]

Both of you have joined this expedition in an attempt to raid the dungeon that lurks at the bottom of the ravine in search of both riches and fame.

00:10:36 [DM]

Due to both of your backgrounds, you don't hail from either of the last bastions of humanity. You've kind of bounced around between mercenary states living on your own, camping in the wilderness, just doing what you can to survive. You both end up being in the same mercenary state.

00:10:53 [DM]

And you end up joining a party in hopes to get some type of money, some type of job, some type of riches, really anything to skirt by.

00:11:02 [DM]

So now your location is. You're walking through this ravine through hundreds and hundreds of feet of packed down snow. The ravine is a whole lot larger than what it seems to be. However, the top of the mountain is covered in snow. It is cold, it is freezing, and you're trudging through the snow just trying to keep afloat.

00:11:22 [DM]

As you're following the two people ahead of you and your party.

00:11:29 [DM]

And that is the scene. Is there anything you guys would like to?

00:11:32 [Christian]

Do are we? Do we know each other?

00:11:35 [DM]

As the at the current moment, we can say you guys don't know.

00:11:38 [DM]

Each other OK.

00:11:39 [Marthah]

We just met. We just met up at the top of this mountain to go into the ravine.

00:11:44 [DM]

Yeah, you guys presumably met at the mercenary Guild, got, you know, join the same party. A lot of people consider this as a death sentence. You know, there. Why would you ever go here? But seeking money, fame and even food on the table you both decide to join the.

00:11:58 [DM]

Decided to join the exhibition party, so presumably know each other by face, maybe by name, but other than that you don't know each other very.

00:12:07 [Marthah]

Well, Christian, what's your name?

00:12:07 Speaker 3

Why?

00:12:12 [Christian]

Aaron Dill is my name.

00:12:15 [Christian]

To have a question, you said that people consider going to saving a death sentence. Why is that? Why is that considered a death sentence?

00:12:24 [DM]

From your knowledge, you think of it as a death sentence due to the.

00:12:27 [DM]

Sheer cold.

00:12:28 [DM]

The almost zero to none mapping of the terrain and the unpredictability of the weather.

00:12:35 [Marthah]

OK.

00:12:36 [Christian]

OK.

00:12:38 Speaker 4

From your knowledge, that's what you know.

00:12:38 [Marthah]

We're doing like some extreme sports right now.

00:12:41 [DM]

Yeah, from your knowledge, that's.

00:12:43 [DM]

What you.

00:12:44 [Marthah]

OK.

00:12:46 [Christian]

So yeah, my my character's name is Erin Dill.

00:12:50 [Marthah]

Do you want to tell me what?

00:12:51 [Marthah]

His race is.

00:12:53 [Christian]

Her race is an earth. Yeah, elf.

00:12:56 Speaker 2

OK.

00:13:00 [Christian]

And yours is what?

00:13:02 [Marthah]

I'm a doe Centaur and my name is Silver Shadow.

00:13:11 [Christian]

Just writing it down for quick reference.

00:13:12 [Marthah]

And I'm a lady.

00:13:14 Speaker 3

And lady.

00:13:17 [DM]

So as you guys are kind of walking through this large, vast opening, if you know what a ravine is like, it is kind of where the two mountains are converging at the bottom and there's presumably, you know, maybe a lake or.

00:13:28 [DM]

Like.

00:13:29 [DM]

More at the bottom, however, you can't see anything. It is covered in hundreds of.

00:13:33 [DM]

Feet of snow and.

00:13:34 [Marthah]

Does the snow go all the way down?

00:13:36 [DM]

It goes almost all the way down.

00:13:38 Speaker 4

As far you you can't, you can't.

00:13:38 [Marthah]

OK, so as far as we can see currently.

00:13:40 [DM]

Really tell because you're kind of walking on top of the snow in between the two large mountain sides on either side of you, and you're just kind of walking down the ravine. You can't really tell how much it goes.

00:13:52 [DM]

Down. But I'm telling you it goes down quite a.

00:13:55 [DM]

Bit OK.

00:13:56 [Christian]

Wait, so I'm having trouble. So. So you're saying this is a ravine?

00:14:00 [Christian]

And the snow is filled up this ravine like.

00:14:03 [DM]

Halfway filled halfway of snow. OK, packed down snow. Spend there for a while. You can walk on.

00:14:10 [Christian]

Top of it, OK. Yeah.

00:14:13 [Christian]

OK.

00:14:15 [DM]

Your exhibition team consists of four people in total. You and Martha are walking in the Revere in the rear, and there are two people walking ahead of you.

00:14:25 [Christian]

What did the two people had look like?

00:14:28 [DM]

You see one ahead of you and it is the leader of the party and he is an elf Ranger carrying a bow and a torch. The torch isn't currently lit, but it's on the side of his body like kind of slinged on.

00:14:40 [DM]

Was built the second person standing next to him is a large, almost ogre looking human. He's probably the largest person you've ever seen in your life. He carries no weapons next to no equipment, and he has just a large tunic with sleeves cut off, covered in tattoos and huge muscles. He is the epitome of a barbarian that fights with his fists.

00:15:06 [Christian]

OK.

00:15:09 [Marthah]

OK.

00:15:11 [Marthah]

Do they have names?

00:15:12 [DM]

They might.

00:15:14 [Marthah]

OK. Uh ohh. I wanna go talk to the tattoo dude.

00:15:15 [DM]

They might have names.

00:15:19 [DM]

OK, so as you as you kind of are walking in a two by two line, you walk up towards the tattooed large figure ahead of you.

00:15:27 [DM]

And he kind of stares at you questionably.

00:15:32 [Marthah]

I'm just going to introduce myself and tell him my name is Silver Shadow. I'm a little nervous and especially by the fact that he doesn't seem to have any weapons or equipment and I want to know what his story is.

00:15:44 [DM]

He starts laughing and you can feel almost the ravine start to shake slightly and you know, you kind of almost like, look at him with a side glance because his Thunder is laughter like.

00:15:56 [DM]

Almost caused an avalanche to happen. Is that big of a human, and he introduces himself as Gore Gor.

00:16:05 [DM]

And his story is he's a mercenary for hire and he doesn't use any weapons because weapons are for babies.

00:16:13

Hmm.

00:16:16 [Marthah]

Booster cuffs.

00:16:20 [DM]

Yes, he does use fisticuffs, OK.

00:16:26 [Marthah]

UM.

00:16:28 [Marthah]

Wait, I'd like to know. OK, go ahead, Christian.

00:16:31 [Christian]

Sorry, what weapon do you have so overshadow?

00:16:35 [Marthah]

I have a.

00:16:36 [Christian]

Dagger. OK, I I personally have a spear.

00:16:40 [Marthah]

A sphere. Nice. OK.

00:16:42 [DM]

Question for you guys. When you do this little like inter person bit, are you like talking to each other in game or are you out of game talking about it?

00:16:49 [Christian]

In game I was intending in game, yeah.

00:16:50 [DM]

And get OK, just just making sure just making sure because I know a lot of campaigns, a lot of people like to go out of game in game. It doesn't matter to me personally. I was just curious that way I can keep in mind, you know you guys talking and other people around understanding.

00:17:03 [Christian]

If I were, if I, like, say, sober shout, I'll try. I'll try to keep that like as like as in game. And then if I sing Martha, then I'll.

00:17:07 [DM]

Gotcha.

00:17:11 [DM]

Distinction.

00:17:13 [DM]

Totally understand. Yeah. Yeah. OK.

00:17:17 [Marthah]

Can I used to dagger cause I like?

00:17:18 [Marthah]

To see the look in their eyes as I kill them, I like to be close and personal.

00:17:23 [DM]

As Martha says that she gets like very close to you, her eyes are like glistening with bloodlust.

00:17:29 [DM]

And you know, she she kind of scares you a little bit. Martha's rolling intimidation check.

00:17:31 [Christian]

The yeah. Cower.

00:17:34 [DM]

Please roll an intimidation check.

00:17:37 [Marthah]

OK. Is that just a D20?

00:17:39 [DM]

Yeah, roll a D20 and then.

00:17:42 [Marthah]

Where can I go to?

00:17:42 [DM]

Roll. OK, I can give you this one I.

00:17:46 [DM]

Like this?

00:17:47 [DM]

00:17:58 [Christian]

SO1D20.

00:18:03 [Marthah]

It rolled on 19.

00:18:04 Speaker 3

Viral.

00:18:05 [DM]

Foundation.

00:18:06 [DM]

Charisma, right? Do you have any charisma modifiers, Martha?

00:18:10 [Marthah]

Ohh ****, I should get that out right?

00:18:13 [DM]

Yeah, you have your character sheet, Christian is intimidation, is charisma, right?

00:18:16 [Marthah]

Look, where is my character? She.

00:18:18 [Christian]

I believe so.

00:18:19 [DM]

Yeah, I'm just gonna go with it. I'm.

00:18:21 [DM]

Pretty I'm like.

00:18:22 [Marthah]

Charisma is plus 1, so it's a dirty 20.

00:18:24 [DM]

Plus, 1/30/20. OK, yeah, Christian roll saving.

00:18:27 [Christian]

Throw. I'm kind of ******.

00:18:28 [DM]

Yeah, roller saving throw.

00:18:33 [Christian]

5 -, 2.

00:18:35 [DM]

Three. Yeah. So you are, like, nearly ******** yourself.

00:18:39 [DM]

As Martha is like holding the dagger up to her, so she like even licks the blade, she's like staring at your eyes, glistening full of bloodlust. Uh. What? What do you what do you do?

00:18:48 [Christian]

You're almost ******** herself here. I I like to honestly just back away because I mean.

00:18:53 [Christian]

Who wants to just?

00:18:55 [Christian]

Who wants to relate to that kind of person? Like I like to be the blood of my enemies.

00:19:00 [DM]

Actually like getting because she is a Centaur. She's quite larger than you, so she's leaning down, you know, like towering over. You're talking about bloodlust. So as you kind of step back to get to get away from her cause, you at this point fear your life. You.

00:19:14 [DM]

To trip on on something buried in the snow and fall back into the snow, yeah.

00:19:21 [Marthah]

I'm going to catch him here.

00:19:23 [Marthah]

I'll. I'll catch her.

00:19:24 [DM]

Thank you, Christian. That is very useful. You're very welcome. I was just going to use my my brain, but I'll use that instead. That works better.

00:19:31 [Christian]

You got it right. So.

00:19:33 [DM]

Wow, look at this. Actually, I'm not going to look at that double. Check me if I'm wrong.

00:19:37 [DM]

All right, well, we'll do.

00:19:40 [DM]

All right.

00:19:41 [DM]

So, Martha, you want to try?

00:19:42 [Marthah]

To catch him. Yeah, yeah.

00:19:44 [Marthah]

I'll try and catch her.

00:19:46 [DM]

OK. I'm sorry. ****. I gotta get used to.

00:19:48 [Christian]

That yeah, sorry.

00:19:48 [DM]

So you you try.

00:19:49 [DM]

To you, no worries. You try to you try to catch her, right. And as you lean forward to catch her, you step on the same thing.

00:19:55 [DM]

That she that she.

00:19:56 [DM]

Tripped on and you looked down and you've crushed a human skull?

00:20:05 [Christian]

Do I notice that she crushed out?

00:20:06 [DM]

Ohh yes, you can very much hear it. You can very much see here crush the skull that you just tripped on.

00:20:12 [Marthah]

Uh, I'm just gonna.

00:20:14 [Marthah]

I'm going to giggle and justice. Kind of.

00:20:17 [Marthah]

Tell it a little bit closer to Arundel.

00:20:21 [Christian]

That.

00:20:21 [Christian]

Doesn't look like your. You didn't use your dagger for that. That was your foot.

00:20:29 [Marthah]

Huh.

00:20:31 [Christian]

Crushing the blood of your enemies, yeah.

00:20:35 [DM]

So as you kind of help help her up off of the snow, you know, you guys just completely brush off the the crushed human skull that you.

00:20:43 [DM]

That you know you tripped on and then she crushed. And then the people, the two people ahead of you, kind of like yelled back and, like, motion their hands for you too, to keep up.

00:20:52 [Christian]

Is it like desperate, like yell back?

00:20:54 [DM]

Or like no more of like.

00:20:56 [DM]

Stop ******* around, you know.

00:20:57 [Christian]

OK, I like to accept this help up and.

00:21:02 [DM]

OK, so you you accept her help up and you kind of stand up, you know, get your bearings and you guys keep trudging along and you've got.

00:21:08 [Christian]

Can I like?

00:21:10 [Christian]

Sorry, can I like try like see. There's like anything around this human.

00:21:13 [Christian]

Skull. Yeah, roll perception.

00:21:18 [DM]

Yeah, don't be afraid to interrupt me if I'm mid monologue. If you want to do something like just just say it. You know, I'm not afraid.

00:21:24 [DM]

To stop and pause.

00:21:26 [Christian]

A perception I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan.

00:21:30 [Christian]

What's the modifier for perception?

00:21:33 [DM]

Modifier for perception **** this is this is.

00:21:36 Speaker 4

A hard one.

00:21:36 [Christian]

Yeah, that's a hard.

00:21:37 [Christian]

1.

00:21:38 [Christian]

Unless you get it right.

00:21:43 [Marthah]

Isn't it intelligence?

00:21:45 [DM]

No, it can't be intelligence.

00:21:51 [DM]

Ambient television can't be charisma. I'm leaning towards Dexter wisdom.

00:21:56 [DM]

I'm gonna roll with wisdom, but I feel like.

00:21:57 [DM]

Martha might be right it.

00:21:58 [Marthah]

His wisdom, I knew it was gonna be intelligence or wisdom.

00:21:58 [Christian]

Is.

00:21:59 [Christian]

Paul, let's go too.

00:22:02 [Marthah]

OK.

00:22:03 [DM]

2 for two, I didn't think it was intelligence because intelligence is usually history and religion checks.

00:22:08 [Christian]

So I've rolled a 16 in a so dirty.

00:22:11 [Christian]

20.

00:22:12 [DM]

3020 alright. So as you're kind of sifting.

00:22:14 [Marthah]

Damn +4 modifier, not bad.

00:22:16 [DM]

As you're kind of like sifting through you kind of like gingerly lift the skull and put it to the side, and you're sifting through the snow and you find you find a small pouch. And other than that, you kind of find the rest of the.

00:22:28 [DM]

Decrepid body of skeleton that is buried beneath the snow, but the only thing that you can see immediately is a small pouch that is almost attached, like kind of like it was pushed in.

00:22:40 [DM]

By the snow like attached to a part of the bone.

00:22:44 [Christian]

The pouch is attached to the bone.

00:22:46 [DM]

Yeah. It's like almost frozen to it, but you find small pouch.

00:22:48 [Christian]

Oh, got you. Can I open open like the pouch?

00:22:50 [DM]

They find a small pouch.

00:22:53 [DM]

Yeah, as you.

00:22:53 [DM]

Kind of fiddle with it and you try to like unfreeze the burlap from the from the.

00:23:00 [DM]

****. What's that bone called? Whatever. It doesn't matter. As you try to, like, release it from the collarbone, you eventually rip it off. And as you rip it off, 3 gold pieces spread onto the floor. Not the floor, rather the snow.

00:23:15 [Christian]

Ah, I'll take the gold pieces.

00:23:18 [DM]

I'll add 3 gold pieces to your inventory.

00:23:25 [DM]

All right, so now you guys, after you're getting the gold pieces, you and Martha kind of trudge along a little, a little faster through the snow and try.

00:23:32 [DM]

To catch up.

00:23:33 [DM]

Were there two party members and you guys are kind of walking through the ravine there. You notice that the ravine is slowly getting thinner and thinner? Not dramatically, but you can tell that you're kind of reaching the end portion.

00:23:47 [DM]

Like almost the start or the edge of the ravine, if you're walking the long ways, you know what I mean? You're kind of reaching where the point of it is, and it's getting slightly thinner and the snow that's coming down is getting heavier and the visibility is slowly going down.

00:24:06 [Christian]

Like visibility due to snow.

00:24:07 [DM]

Due to the snow due to the slight.

00:24:11 [Christian]

Right.

00:24:11 [DM]

Snow drifts from wind.

00:24:13 [Christian]

Is it? Is it currently like snowing?

00:24:15 [DM]

It's currently snowing. Yes. OK.

00:24:20 [DM]

It's been snowing ever since you've been here.

00:24:25 [Marthah]

So the snow is getting heavier.

00:24:27 Speaker 4

And.

00:24:27 [DM]

Yes, the snow is getting heavier and the wind is blowing. The snow drifts and your visibility is slowly getting worse as you continue.

00:24:38 [Christian]

UMI like to yell to the two ahead of like uh and ask it for it going the right way.

00:24:44 [DM]

OK. So as you kind of like your voice carries through the through the ravine as it kind of echoes.

00:24:48 Speaker 4

Their.

00:24:50 [DM]

And one of them turns around the the big man Gore and says, of course we're going the right way. There is only two ways the North and South.

00:25:01 [Christian]

So you know we're going north, huh?

00:25:05 [DM]

To be fair, he didn't tell you which way. He just said there are only two ways.

00:25:12 [Christian]

Is there?

00:25:13 [Christian]

Nothing else of note in the like Ravine Mall, so other than just getting there.

00:25:19 [DM]

I'm not sure.

00:25:20 [DM]

There could be.

00:25:22 [Christian]

Can I make a perception check on that?

00:25:25 [DM]

Oh yeah. What are you going to perceive?

00:25:27 [DM]

What do you want to do with this?

00:25:28 [Christian]

If if there's like any kind of.

00:25:32 [DM]

Like.

00:25:33 [Christian]

Unnatural formation within the rock of.

00:25:36 [DM]

A natural formation. OK, OK, role perception.

00:25:41 [DM]

For unnatural things in the rocks.

00:25:44 [Christian]

9 + 413.

00:25:47 [DM]

So with the 13 you can't notice anything out of the ordinary. You notice some of the rocks have kind of like fallen and deteriorated over time.

00:25:56 [DM]

That you don't see.

00:25:57 [DM]

Anything out of the ordinary?

00:26:00 [DM]

You see a few arrows sticking into the walls of the ravine. Old arrows. You can tell the wood is starting to rot. They've been there for a while. Other than that, you don't notice anything out of the ordinary.

00:26:11 Speaker 3

Yes.

00:26:12 [Marthah]

Can I do a perception check to see if there's any signs of?

00:26:23 [Marthah]

Any one being near?

00:26:26 Speaker 4

Yeah, of course.

00:26:26 [Marthah]

Or having gone down this way.

00:26:28 [DM]

Yeah, of course you can. Like, look for footprints or like, listen, stuff like that, man.

00:26:32 [Marthah]

OK, that's just one D20.

00:26:34 [DM]

Yep, 1D20 and then. Plus your wisdom, right, it's perception.

00:26:38 [Marthah]

OK, so that is A7.

00:26:40 [DM]

Seven, you don't really notice anything. It's snowing too hard. If there were footprints, you know, they kind of disappear over time. You don't notice anything out of the ordinary. You're kind of looking to see if you've seen anyone else following you around you and you. You don't see anything, but you do have this, like, sneaking suspicion that you are being followed or watched.

00:27:02 [DM]

You don't notice anything but you. You almost feel that way versus it could be, you know, instinct. It could be a feeling could be vibes.

00:27:09 [DM]

Or it could just be you being afraid of being in a large ravine.

00:27:10 [Marthah]

I've just got the.

00:27:13 [Marthah]

Yeah, I've got the creepy crawlies. Yeah, OK.

00:27:15 [DM]

Absolutely.

00:27:18 [Marthah]

OK. Can I ask the Ranger? Uh, how much further we have to go?

00:27:24 [DM]

Yeah, of course. So you, you know, kind of.

00:27:27 [DM]

Do you want to walk closer to?

00:27:28 [Marthah]

Him or yell? I'd like to get up.

00:27:30 [Marthah]

Closer to him, OK.

00:27:33 [DM]

So you you kind of like, you know, gallop I guess is the correct term for Centaur, you kind of galloped towards him and you, sorry, what was your question again, I got distracted by galloping I.

00:27:43 [DM]

Thought it was funny.

00:27:46 [Marthah]

Me too. Don't worry, I'm just curious how much further we have to go.

00:27:50 [DM]

OK, so you walk over to him and his name is Lou. That is the ranges and by the.

00:27:53 Speaker 2

Blue.

00:27:55 [DM]

And lugos it is only about 300 feet further down. We're going north where we came from was S you guys entered in through the port in the South. You climbed through the through the bridge and then you got there and you kept walking. You've gone for quite a bit. You've gone for a few miles, you know, you've gone down the ravine. And he says it's maybe maybe about a rough estimate.

00:28:16 [DM]

Would be like 2 to 300 feet further.

00:28:19 [DM]

However, it's kind of difficult to see. You can't see much farther than a few feet in front of you because of due to the snow and the the wind drifts. But he thinks that you should be there quite soon.

00:28:30 [Marthah]

OK, I'm gonna ask him.

00:28:35 [Marthah]

What's his plan? Like? What's the game plan? What does he? How does he want to approach this thing?

00:28:39 [Christian]

Why are we even here in the first place?

00:28:42 [DM]

Is is out there?

00:28:43 [Marthah]

We're raiding a dungeon.

00:28:44 [Christian]

Yes. A dungeon. OK, yeah.

00:28:47 [DM]

Come on, Christian, pay attention as.

00:28:48 [DM]

Sorry.

00:28:49 [Christian]

I am trying OK.

00:28:51 [DM]

Thank you for remembering that, Martha. So do you want?

00:28:53 [Marthah]

Yeah.

00:28:54 [DM]

Me to remind you why you here.

00:28:56 [Christian]

Yeah. Please, sorry.

00:28:58 [DM]

No, no worries. Feel free to ask questions. We're having fun here. So the reason why you're here is you're in the great ravine of.

00:29:03 [DM]

The desolated king.

00:29:04 [DM]

Right. And this is a cold winter Biome. There are. There's one very large like.

00:29:11 [DM]

You can't even see the top of the mountain in clear conditions. That's how big this mount is. And then there's a few other offshoots and you're in the great ravine in between the major mountain and and wear.

00:29:23 [DM]

Some of the smaller mountains and then the ocean would be or water. Presumably, and you're walking down this ravine to go to what most people say. There's a dungeon at the end of here that hasn't been raided in 100 years and is full of riches.

00:29:37 [Christian]

Oh, OK, OK, that's the I I must have missed the rated part because I've probably heard like people haven't been here. I I I I heard people haven't been here in years. I didn't realize rated was the word right.

00:29:45 Speaker 4

Yeah.

00:29:46 Speaker 4

Got you.

00:29:55 Speaker 3

So.

00:29:56 [Christian]

So we're about, what, 300 feet out? The guy said.

00:29:59 Speaker 4

That's what he.

00:30:00 [DM]

Said he said. You're 300 feet away.

00:30:00 [Christian]

Did did, did did I?

00:30:03 [Christian]

Hear this conversation that Martin had.

00:30:05 [DM]

With you can hear bits and pieces, but you're not close enough at this exact moment. Let's say he's still midway through talking to her. If you want to run and catch up.

00:30:14 [Christian]

Yeah, I'll do that.

00:30:15 [DM]

OK. So you kind of like trot along and try to catch up and Martha's galloping quite fast and you end up actually catching most of the conversation.

00:30:22 [DM]

And then Martha asked him what what his plan is.

00:30:25 [DM]

And he begins to start to talk about his plan. And midway through, he's interrupted. Please enroll perception.

00:30:32 [DM]

Both of you.

00:30:36 [DM]

I want to see if either of you can catch this.

00:30:38 [Marthah]

11/11.

00:30:39 [Christian]

9.

00:30:40 [DM]

OK, so neither of you catch us. So midway through his conversation, he's talking to and he has his back turned. And you see a stray arrow hit him in the back of the neck.

00:30:50 [DM]

And then you see another arrow hit him in the back of the neck, and then he falls forward in between both of you and lays onto the Snow roll initiative.

00:30:58 [Marthah]

Uh, one second I have somebody at my door. I had to call the cops on my neighbors earlier and the husband is now knocking on my door, so I will be right back.

00:31:06 Speaker 4

Oh, good luck. Oh boy.

00:31:10 [DM]

A small intermission.

00:31:14 [Christian]

You should have said should have said. That's nothing.

00:31:18 [DM]

There was.

00:31:18 [DM]

You got to see if you catch this. Nothing good. No, none of you catch it and then just continue.

00:31:26 [Christian]

Roll perception check. There appears to be nothing.

00:31:26 Speaker 4

I've I've done it before.

00:31:30 [DM]

You got a Nat 20. Good, there is nothing.

00:31:32 [Christian]

There is, yeah, that that's when you really should start shooting bricks.

00:31:36 [DM]

Yeah, you're like **** dude.

00:31:38 [DM]

I didn't get it within that 20.

00:31:41 [DM]

That's the epitome of of railroading your campaign.

00:31:42 [Christian]

No, no. Imagine not. DC is 30. You need it. Yeah, you're like.

00:31:52 [DM]

I'm like **** you see nothing.

00:31:53 [Christian]

You see.

00:31:55 [Christian]

My favorite.

00:31:56 [Christian]

Joke.

00:31:57 [DM]

You start using all your spells to buff, you leave and use. It's like an inspiration point to roll again, you start.

00:32:02 [DM]

Using everything and I'm like you have noticed nothing.

00:32:03 Speaker 3

This.

00:32:05 [Christian]

There was a funny post I saw online where.

00:32:09 [Christian]

It was something online, so like it was something like a DC-25, like perception check or something like that. They he rolled a 25. There wasn't there was there. There was an actuality. Nothing.

00:32:20 [Christian]

But the DM didn't know what to say, so he ended up saying for like a brief moment instant.

00:32:27 [Christian]

You you appear to see.

00:32:29 [Christian]

Giants staring down. He's. Yes, I've seen that.

00:32:32 Speaker 2

Yeah.

00:32:34 Speaker 4

I love it. I love that.

00:32:35 Speaker 4

1.

00:32:36 [DM]

For a fleeting moment, you've seen, you've see eyes, someone almost seems to be picking you up and moving you 30 feet up.

00:32:44

You know like.

00:32:46 [DM]

It was for a fleeting moment, you're

00:32:48 [Christian]

Very brief moment.

00:32:48 [DM]

Think you're going crazy?

00:32:52 [DM]

The gods would kill you for this heresy.

00:32:55 [Christian]

You shake the preposterous thought outside your mind.

00:32:59 Speaker 3

What do you mean?

00:33:00

Oh.

00:33:00 [DM]

I thank you for reminding me, Christian.

00:33:04 [DM]

Of something very important I need to do.

00:33:09 [DM]

Good thing Martha is taking a slight intermission because I forgot to do something very important.

00:33:17 [Christian]

Does have to do with me?

00:33:18 Speaker 4

It does.

00:33:29 [Christian]

Damn, what a lovely first impression. Now I like killing people. My dagger.

00:33:34 [DM]

You know, it's so funny that she that she's a an assassin as as a.

00:33:40 [Christian]

Wait, So what race is she?

00:33:42 Speaker 4

As a.

00:33:44 [DM]

Centaur dos Centaur.

00:33:47 [DM]

Centaur never heard of that adores Dos Centaur assassin. That is really.

00:33:51 [DM]

Interesting to me.

00:33:53 [Christian]

Oh, so she's like an actually a Centaur.

00:33:55 [DM]

Yep.

00:33:56 [Christian]

That's cool.

00:34:01 Speaker 4

OK, I'm back. Welcome back. Sorry.

00:34:03 [Christian]

You in trouble, Martha.

00:34:05 [DM]

Martha, you're not back. You're not back. Can you go? Can you not say anything for 30 seconds? Pretend you're not back. I'm doing something right now. I was hoping you'd be back when?

00:34:13 [Marthah]

I was done, OK.

00:34:15 [Christian]

Yeah, I got. I somehow reminded him of something. I don't know what it is, but I I may have ****** us over. I have no idea.

00:34:25 [Christian]

Ohh, she actually go away.

00:34:29 Speaker 4

She'll be back in like a few seconds. I'm almost done.

00:34:31 [Christian]

30.

00:34:32 [Christian]

Yeah.

00:34:44 [DM]

Alright, I'm done.

00:34:45 [DM]

You can. Thank you, Martha. I appreciate.

00:34:47 [DM]

It.

00:34:47 Speaker 3

OK.

00:34:51 [DM]

I almost forgot that Christian, I almost forgot.

00:34:54 [Christian]

I thought it wasn't taking effect yet.

00:34:57 [DM]

Nope, it is.

00:34:59

It is.

00:35:03 [Marthah]

OK, I have returned.

00:35:04 [Christian]

Welcome back.

00:35:06 [Marthah]

Thank you.

00:35:07 [DM]

Thank you, Martha. It's good to good.

00:35:08 Speaker 4

To be back.

00:35:09 [Marthah]

Yeah.

00:35:11 [DM]

All right, all right. Is everything OK?

00:35:13 Speaker 4

Like you're good.

00:35:14 Speaker 3

Mm-hmm.

00:35:15 [Marthah]

OK, OK. Yeah, they're arguing for an hour today. Like screaming.

00:35:21 [Marthah]

So I finally called the cops and was like, yo, this is going on for going on for an hour. It's happened before, yadda yadda yadda.

00:35:28 [Marthah]

Cops came. They were in there for like, 20 minutes. Then they left. I have a ring doorbell camera. So when the cops left, I, like, saw their recording and the cops were like, that was uncomfortable. And then so the husband just knocked on my door and was like, hey, please don't tell the office about this because they're already trying to kick us out. And, like, I don't want that to happen.

00:35:38

Yes.

00:35:49 [Marthah]

And I was just like, well, I don't want to hear you guys fighting, so.

00:35:52 Speaker 4

Yeah. So I mean maybe.

00:35:53 [Marthah]

Here we are.

00:35:54 Speaker 2

Yeah, we don't, we both.

00:35:56 Speaker 2

Don't want things to.

00:35:57 [Christian]

Martha's Marvin's got Stephanie fired. Deeper haired. What she.

00:36:00 [Christian]

Might do to.

00:36:01 Speaker 4

You you gonna get you ******* evicted.

00:36:05 Speaker 4

Else is gone.

00:36:06 [Marthah]

Losing their jobs, their homes.

00:36:08 [DM]

House gone. Job gone family.

00:36:11 [Marthah]

Now I just got to work on the car.

00:36:13 [DM]

Yeah, because you got a house, you got, you got a job gone, right? You're working on the House, right? You're working on, like, solidifying their divorce. And then now you're now you're up.

00:36:25 [Christian]

To the car's got her fingers all behind the scenes.

00:36:29 [Christian]

No, no, no, no.

00:36:30 [DM]

No, Martha already got their car gone. She sent me that picture of.

00:36:34 [DM]

Someones car she had.

00:36:34 Speaker 3

Ohh yeah.

00:36:36 [DM]

Oh, my God, she's already got the car stuff done. She's she's ahead of the game.

00:36:40 Speaker 3

She she's on A roll.

00:36:40 [Marthah]

Did you see that, Christian?

00:36:42 [Christian]

Ohh no I did not.

00:36:43 [Marthah]

No. OK, I'm going to send you the car right now.

00:36:46 Speaker 4

Jeez, on a roll.

00:36:47 [Marthah]

Even even I like you, who knows nothing about cars new. There's something wrong here.

00:36:54 Speaker 4

Yep.

00:36:57 [DM]

I'm almost 90% sure I know how that happened.

00:36:59 [Christian]

I'm not sure, but I see it wrong with that image.

00:37:05 [Christian]

Where the hell did the side mirror?

00:37:09 Speaker 4

You can you can definitely.

00:37:10 [DM]

Be buffed out for sure.

00:37:12 [Marthah]

Yeah, for sure. Just just a good iron, I think.

00:37:15 [DM]

Maybe some duct tape you.

00:37:16 Speaker 4

Know, I mean, I don't know.

00:37:17 [Christian]

No, not just duct tape. Speed tape we need. That's that. That's speed tape right here. Duct tape won't work.

00:37:25 [DM]

I think we could also probably put like a piece of plastic wrap on it so that like when they're driving down the highway going.

00:37:32 Speaker 4

You know.

00:37:33 [DM]

I think that could work.

00:37:36 [DM]

Alright, anyways, let's pretend nothing happened. You guys don't hear anything and as and he's while he's in the middle of explaining your plan, he like just gets the first syllable out. You see one arrow stabbing to the back of his neck and it points through the other. The other side of his neck. Then you see another arrow stabbing to the back of his neck and it points through the other side of the neck and he falls down into the snow.

00:37:57 [DM]

Between you roll initiative.

00:37:58 Speaker 3

Is he dead?

00:38:01 [Christian]

He's dead. He's dead.

00:38:03 [Marthah]

I just learned this guy's name.

00:38:05 [DM]

What's his name? What's his name? Martha Lou. His name is Lou. Congratulations.

00:38:10 [Christian]

Oh, I just dropped the dice on the floor #7.

00:38:15 [Marthah]

I wrote in 18.

00:38:17 [Marthah]

That's with my modifier.

00:38:19

That's pretty good.

00:38:21 [DM]

1212, OK.

00:38:23 [Christian]

I'll take. I'll take the upper half. I'm happy.

00:38:27 [DM]

So, well, wait. ******* gory. Just.

00:38:31 Speaker 4

Yeah.

00:38:31 [DM]

Lore is alive in fact.

00:38:33 [Christian]

Lou is not though Lou is.

00:38:36 [DM]

Loose dead. Lose dead.

00:38:37 [Christian]

He's taking a nap. OK, a prolonged extended nap.

00:38:40 Speaker 2

He was a leader.

00:38:43 [DM]

He was.

00:38:44 [DM]

Yeah, Martha. Martha. What'd you get?

00:38:46 [Christian]

Again, let me make sure 18, I believe, yeah.

00:38:56 [DM]

You got 12 recording or 13.

00:38:58 [DM]

I got 1212. I don't feel like putting it in. I put. Martha. You're Martha now, Martha.

00:39:05 [Christian]

Darth Darth Marth, Darth marth?

00:39:06 [DM]

Agree.

00:39:07 [DM]

Sorry, mark.

00:39:09 [DM]

So as as you know, he falls to the ground. You guys all move around looking in every direction you can possibly see. And you, you hear, like a cynic cynic, sinister laugh.

00:39:20 [DM]

Coming from beyond the clouds of smoke, not smoke beyond the clouds of snow and the snow coming down, you hear a sinister laugh is too small. Goblins holding scimitars approach you.

00:39:33 [DM]

So.

00:39:34 [DM]

Martha, you are first in combat caution.

00:39:38 [Christian]

Yeah, two goblins. Countless monsters.

00:39:40 [DM]

Yes, goblins do count as monsters. Darn.

00:39:43 [Christian]

I mean what?

00:39:44 [Christian]

Me. Who? Where, how, how, what?

00:39:49 [DM]

When?

00:39:51 [Christian]

Perhaps.

00:39:52 [DM]

Because.

00:39:55 [Marthah]

OK, so how far from us are they?

00:39:57 [DM]

The two problems that are approached you are you can vaguely see their silhouettes are probably 20 feet away.

00:40:05 [Marthah]

OK, I have a movement speed of 50, so I would like to go to the closest one, get up to him and then I'd like to roll to damage.

00:40:18 [DM]

All right.

00:40:19 [DM]

Roll to see if you hit him.

00:40:23 [Marthah]

Ah.

00:40:26 [Marthah]

13.

00:40:27 [DM]

13 hits roll damage.

00:40:33 [Marthah]

Six damage, 6 damage.

00:40:34 [DM]

So are you attacking with your dagger? Yeah. OK, so you run up to the goblin at, like, breakneck speeds. You were kicking snow behind you, everything. And as the goblins appeared to be confident in their advantage, the one goblin that you single out starts to shift.

00:40:50 [DM]

Pants, right. Because there's a large Centaur carrying a normal sized dagger just running them down.

00:40:57 [DM]

And as you run closer, you stab it into his shoulder and he actually drops his weapon and he starts screaming out in pain because because of your sheer size and sheer strength, you have almost ripped off of it. His, like his left shoulder.

00:41:10 [Marthah]

Hell yeah.

00:41:11 [DM]

And now it is his turn. So as you kind of ripped off the goblin shoulder, he kind of tries to recover and he kind of scatters away from you. He completely forgetting his weapon. And he kind of runs away into the into the.

00:41:26 [DM]

Into the mist and you can't really. Can't really see him. He's kind of crawling away from you. The goblin next to him. That you didn't attack is going to make an attack on you with his scimitar.

00:41:37 [DM]

Let's see what's your armor class.

00:41:39 [Marthah]

14.

00:41:45

That's just.

00:41:45 [DM]

I hate having good roles.

00:41:48 [DM]

So the goblin takes out a scimitar enraged by his friend being attacked, and he swings at you, hitting one of one of your feet.

00:41:58 [DM]

And he deals 2 damage to you.

00:42:00 [Marthah]

OK.

00:42:02 [DM]

The goblin rolled in that 20, by the way.

00:42:05 [DM]

That's why I said. That's why I.

00:42:06 [DM]

Said I hate hate.

00:42:07 [Christian]

Wait, what's up? Not Tony policy that we're doing double damage.

00:42:10 [DM]

For you guys, it's done for, for you guys, it's 2 rolls of damage.

00:42:15 [Christian]

OK.

00:42:16 [DM]

In this specific answer, in this specific instance, the monster also got two roles but he.

00:42:23 [DM]

Rolled one on both of them, so yeah.

00:42:26 Speaker 3

I I was just curious.

00:42:27 Speaker 4

Yeah. Yep.

00:42:27 [Christian]

Cause I know some people do one roll double or two rows.

00:42:30 [DM]

Yeah, I just, I just do your roll damage dice twice, that's what.

00:42:33 [DM]

I do OK.

00:42:35 [DM]

So you get a Nat 28th, it's AD 6 year old 2D sixes, and if your D6 is like plus one.

00:42:40 [DM]

The Max you could do is what is that?

00:42:45 [DM]

Wow, I can't do math right now. 14. Yeah, I'm actually going to.

00:42:48 [DM]

Do it 14.

00:42:50 [DM]

All right, anyways, now it is Gore, Gore and raged. Kind of like runs at the second goblin.

00:42:57 [DM]

And he jumps all.

00:42:58 [DM]

Over you with like and.

00:43:01 [DM]

Unbelievable acrobatics, Marty. He jumps over you and he attempts to drop kick the goblin with his feet.

00:43:08 [DM]

Gore misses entirely and lands on his ***. Christian, it's your turn. So.

00:43:12

Hey.

00:43:14 [Christian]

Just to so, there's two goblins, right?

00:43:17 [DM]

At you can see one goblin crawling away from Martha on his hands and knees. The other goblin is in between Gore and Martha.

00:43:24 [Christian]

And how far was that Second Goblin?

00:43:27 [DM]

You are about 40 feet from the 2nd goblin, the goblin that is in between Martha and Gore is.

00:43:32 [DM]

About 20 feet away.

00:43:34 [Christian]

I got you the one that's.

00:43:37 [Christian]

The one that's 20 feet away, OK.

00:43:41 [Christian]

And I just like to attack my spear.

00:43:43 Speaker 4

Alright, roll, roll the hit.

00:43:51 [Christian]

Sorry.

00:43:53

Uh.

00:43:55 [Christian]

Just eight hit.

00:43:56 [DM]

8 does not hit, so you you swing your spear at the goblin and you almost feel like you have a dead center hit onto his chest and he expertly dodges and like kind of swivels around and flanks you.

00:44:10 [DM]

Now.

00:44:13 [DM]

What's your class Christian 12?

00:44:16 [DM]

12.

00:44:20 [DM]

Wow, you are one lucky son of.

00:44:22 [DM]

A *****. So.

00:44:22 [Christian]

Tie does hit, by the way.

00:44:25 [DM]

I know you were one lucky *** ** * *****. So as you're as you're standing there, you missed the goblin.

00:44:27 Speaker 4

Yes.

00:44:30 [DM]

You see three arrows come at you in three different directions.

00:44:35 [DM]

And both of the arrows miss you entirely, and one just barely grazes your skin.

00:44:43 [DM]

Martha, it's now your turn.

00:44:46 [Marthah]

OK. And I'm right up next to the one.

00:44:50 [Marthah]

Cuz he rushed me right.

00:44:52 Speaker 2

Yes.

00:44:53 [DM]

You you are all within like 1 foot of each other. You're quite close. You were almost surrounding this poor girl.

00:45:00 [Marthah]

OK.

00:45:02 [Marthah]

I am going to do an attack without a weapon.

00:45:09 [DM]

On on arm stroke.

00:45:09 [Marthah]

I just kind.

00:45:09 [Marthah]

Of.

00:45:10 [Marthah]

An unarmed strike? Yeah.

00:45:11 Speaker 4

OK.

00:45:13 [Marthah]

That is.

00:45:16 [DM]

Are you going for non lethal here or are you going for lethal?

00:45:20 [Marthah]

Non lethal. I'd like to. Yeah. Knock him out. Cause I wanna know who the **** they are. Kind of.

00:45:21 Speaker 4

Not lethal, OK?

00:45:26 Speaker 4

OK.

00:45:27 [Marthah]

So I'd like to leave one alive.

00:45:31 [Marthah]

So that's just a straight roll, right? Do I add my strength modifier?

00:45:35 [DM]

Oh yeah, do a regular D20 plus strength.

00:45:38 [Marthah]

OK, so that's 16.

00:45:40 [DM]

16 I'll give you +2 because you're it doesn't matter, but you're flanking, so you'll get a + 2 hit you you hit him. So as you're kind of flanking him, you kind of put your sword your rather your dagger. You like. She's your dagger quickly and you absolutely upper cut the **** out of this goblin.

00:45:58 [DM]

Roll a D6 for damage.

00:46:00 [Marthah]

D6 OK uh, two.

00:46:03 [DM]

Too. So you uppercut the **** out of him and he falls on his ***. He's still he's still conscious, but, but his legs are a little shaky.

00:46:13 [DM]

So now the the goblin that is crawling away from you guys.

00:46:18 [DM]

One second.

00:46:19 [Christian]

Just trying his best, OK?

00:46:22 [Christian]

The poor goblin.

00:46:24 [DM]

I just had to reply to a message.

00:46:27 [DM]

He's kind of crawling away.

00:46:30 [DM]

And as you still crawling away, you see an arrow sticking to the back of his head and he dies.

00:46:37 [DM]

Now the the number 2 goblin that you upper cutted the **** out of, he tries to stand up and he can't manage to get his ground and he keeps kind of falling over.

00:46:47 [DM]

And so now it's so now it's Gores turn.

00:46:50 [DM]

Gore, enraged at the presumable death of his friend Lou.

00:46:56 [DM]

Takes both of his fists and intertwines his fingers and raises them as high as he can, and he crashes down on the goblin skull, crushing it to smithereens. There's blood and guts everywhere.

00:47:06 [Marthah]

I like gore.

00:47:10 [DM]

Christian.

00:47:11 [DM]

You're.

00:47:13 [Christian]

UM.

00:47:15 [Christian]

So, so the first Goblin died due to an arrow, he said. And then the second one just got murdered by what's his name, Gore.

00:47:19 [DM]

Yes, he died by an arrow.

00:47:25 [DM]

Gore, Gore crushed the **** out of his skull.

00:47:29 [Christian]

Where did that first? Can I make a check of where that first error?

00:47:32 [Christian]

Came from? Yep.

00:47:36 Speaker 3

Hmm.

00:47:37 [DM]

It's a good check for this.

00:47:41 [DM]

Trying to think if there's like.

00:47:43 [DM]

We could check for this, you know.

00:47:45 Speaker 2

Yep.

00:47:50 [DM]

I'm going to say acrobatics, do a dex check.

00:47:53 [DM]

Because you do, you did dodge one, just narrowly. It crazy.

00:47:56 [DM]

Yeah. Yeah. So we'll go for a deck check. You kind of have a vague idea.

00:48:00 [DM]

Of where it was coming from.

00:48:04 [Christian]

Oh, hell yeah, a three.

00:48:06 [DM]

Three. So you go, you you kind of turn around invigorated. You know, you're one of the arrows grades you. You know where this came from?

00:48:14 [DM]

And you turn around and you rush in One Direction.

00:48:16 [DM]

And you see nothing.

00:48:19 [Christian]

Damn it.

00:48:20 [DM]

As you rush in that One Direction coincidentally.

00:48:24 [DM]

2 feet away from you, an arrow.

00:48:26 [DM]

Lies at your face.

00:48:30 [DM]

And that is.

00:48:32 [Christian]

Is that my wow, that's that action.

00:48:33 Speaker 4

That does hit you.

00:48:36 [DM]

Oh yes, that was that was your action. I decide. I decided it was your action.

00:48:37 [Christian]

OK.

00:48:42 [DM]

I totally didn't forget that you had an action. I promise. So as as you kind of rush and I totally didn't forget I.

00:48:45

OK.

00:48:50 [DM]

Promise. Don't worry.

00:48:51 [Christian]

Technically, doing a check is can be considering actions, yeah.

00:48:55 [DM]

Perfect. I've definitely didn't forget them.

00:48:56 Speaker 3

Yeah.

00:48:58 [DM]

So as you're kind of rush in that direction as you're running, you kind of stop and look around and an arrow sticks into the back of your leg. Please take two hit points of damage.

00:49:11 [DM]

And now you know exactly where he is.

00:49:14 [DM]

He is like.

00:49:15 [DM]

Probably 20 feet to your E you know exactly where.

00:49:18 [DM]

He is now.

00:49:22 [DM]

And now?

00:49:25 [Christian]

20 feet to my EI. Thought to the north-south for everything.

00:49:26

Myself.

00:49:29 [DM]

It is.

00:49:31 [DM]

North-south for main directions.

00:49:34 [Christian]

OK. So it's just like caught wide 3 Venus.

00:49:36

Yep.

00:49:39 [DM]

Martha, what's your AC?

00:49:42 [Marthah]

14.

00:49:43 [DM]

14.

00:49:44 [DM]

So as you're as you're standing there, you know, completely awestruck at the sheer violence that gore just unleashed upon this, this goblin.

00:49:52 [Christian]

Not for a SEC. I wish I could do that, man. I really didn't.

00:49:52 [DM]

You see two.

00:49:55 [DM]

Terrell, you see two arrows fly right past your head on either side and nail into both sides of Gores arms. And each of his shoulders.

00:50:07 [DM]

Martha, it's your turn.

00:50:09 [Marthah]

OK, so I want to go after because I watched Christian being *******.

00:50:17 [Marthah]

The attempted skewering of Christian of Arundel.

00:50:21 Speaker 4

Yep.

00:50:23 [Marthah]

And I saw the direction that he was going in, right?

00:50:25 [DM]

Yep you did.

00:50:26 [Marthah]

All right, so I.

00:50:27 [Marthah]

Would like to go in that direction until I find someone.

00:50:32 [DM]

OK. Let me just make sure. All right, so you kind of run towards Christian and you notice the trajectory of the arrow sticking in his leg. And you can presume you use about.

00:50:44 [DM]

Maybe 30 feet of movement to get to Christian and you know that the that the arrow came somewhere from the east, presumably 20 feet away.

00:50:55 [DM]

So you've run about 30 feet to Christian.

00:50:58 [Marthah]

OK, so I'm going to go 20 feet in the direction of where I assume the arrows are coming from because I have 50.

00:51:03 [DM]

OK, so you run 20? Yep, you run 20 feet.

00:51:06 [DM]

And you were, like, face to face with a goblin holding a bow.

00:51:11 [Marthah]

Alright, I'm gonna ******* roll the hit with my dagger **** out.

00:51:14 Speaker 4

All right, roll this.

00:51:18 [Marthah]

UM.

00:51:19 [Marthah]

That's a dirty 20.

00:51:21 [DM]

3020 So you take out your dagger and you do you want me to describe or do you want to scrub it? You got a 3020? I'll give it to you if you want.

00:51:29 [DM]

Do you want to describe how you kill?

00:51:31 [Marthah]

Uh, yeah, I'd like to take it from his navel up to his nasty looking little mouth.

00:51:38 [DM]

Alright, so he stab into his navel and rip up to the top of his mouth rolled damage just for ***** and giggles. He's he died. He died, but just for ***** and giggles.

00:51:47 Speaker 4

3/3 He still dies, doesn't.

00:51:48

For.

00:51:50 [DM]

Matter. He still dies. You as you as you rip apart his face with your dagger. You notice that he's actually covered in battle wounds and he's bleeding profusely and you're just kind of.

00:51:50

Hey.

00:52:01 [DM]

Finished the blow.

00:52:04 [Christian]

It was that the same goblin that I.

00:52:07 [Christian]

Song.

00:52:08 [DM]

Yes, OK. You can you can see.

00:52:11 [DM]

Martha, about 20 feet away, and she just ****** ** that gobble.

00:52:14 [DM]

Gotcha, right. And but both of you knows that he's clearly.

00:52:16 [DM]

Covered in wounds.

00:52:19 [DM]

Just just a fair observation.

00:52:21 [Marthah]

OK, so it looks like we walked into a battlefield.

00:52:24 [DM]

Like one damage was enough to kill him. To be fair, as long as you hit him, he would have died.

00:52:29 [Christian]

OK.

00:52:30 [DM]

Now Gore, enraged by being attacked by two goblins.

00:52:35 [DM]

And let's see if he can actually figure out where they're coming from.

00:52:42 [DM]

Gore, in his rage, runs the complete opposite direction of the two arrows that attacked him, and he runs into the mist and you can no.

00:52:50 [Marthah]

Longer. See him? I love gore. He's an idiot.

00:52:54 [DM]

Christian Europe.

00:52:55 [Christian]

So.

00:52:58 [Christian]

If my calculations my intense calculations are correct there.

00:53:07 [Christian]

Two arrows for our sad boy who's dead or presumably dead, rather.

00:53:14 [Christian]

There were, what, two more at the time the hit Gore.

00:53:18 [Christian]

Correct. I got hit by one, but that's already taken care of.

00:53:21 [DM]

Correct.

00:53:24 [Christian]

So there's at least the one more Archer somewhere.

00:53:31 [Christian]

At least one.

00:53:33 [Christian]

Can I?

00:53:37 [Christian]

I assumed the arrow that was stuck in that got shot into me was the one that marford just murdered, correct?

00:53:46 [Christian]

Do I know?

00:53:48 [Christian]

Where the other Archer could be from the trajectory of the times that Lou got shot and the time at Gore got.

00:53:54 [DM]

Shot in Gores absolute idiot facade of running the absolute opposite direction of being hit by the arrows. You do in fact know exactly where you got shot.

00:54:04 [Christian]

Ah.

00:54:05 [DM]

You know the general.

00:54:06 [Christian]

Direction I would like to walk in that direction and just to see if I happen upon this goblin happenstance.

00:54:13 [DM]

You want to use all of.

00:54:13 [DM]

Your movement 30 feet.

00:54:15 [DM]

Please so you use 30 feet, you have 30 feet, right?

00:54:18 [DM]

That's your mouse.

00:54:19 [DM]

Yes. Yeah. OK. So you move 30 feet and you pass where Gore was. You kind of in a hustle run over there.

00:54:24 [DM]

And you see two goblins holding short bows, also covered in wounds, and they seem surprised to.

00:54:31 [Christian]

See you. Am I within melee range?

00:54:34 [DM]

You are within melee range with because you have a.

00:54:37 [DM]

Spear. Yeah. Yeah. OK.

00:54:38 [DM]

If you didn't have a spear.

00:54:39 [Christian]

You wouldn't be. I'd like to roll.

00:54:41 [DM]

To attack alright, you can only hit one of them. One of them is a.

00:54:43 [Christian]

Yeah, yeah, just watch.

00:54:44 [DM]

Little out of your reach.

00:54:45 [DM]

One's a little out of your reach. So. So you have one. Alright, we'll roll to save yet.

00:54:51 [Christian]

******* ****** *** rolls.

00:54:55 [Christian]

11.

00:54:56 [DM]

That does not hit.

00:54:57 [DM]

So you kind of like just your spear out, but he's just quite out of range and you miss.

00:55:05 [DM]

That carbon.

00:55:07 [DM]

Jumps back and tries to shoot you with his bow.

00:55:11 [DM]

And he misses entirely.

00:55:15 [DM]

The other goblin trying to save his friend shoots you with his bow.

00:55:19 [DM]

And that's in that one. He kind of steps forward to get a better angle and trips on a.

00:55:24 [DM]

Rock and face plants.

00:55:26 [Marthah]

Let's go point laugh, OK.

00:55:28 [DM]

Mark, that's your thing. Make your time.

00:55:34 [DM]

These goblin rolls are so terrible. Dude. I got a Nat 20 and A1 already. It's the first session.

00:55:36 Speaker 3

Roads are.

00:55:37 [Marthah]

Terrible for me.

00:55:43 [Christian]

I've only rolled one dice roll above a 10 OK.

00:55:48 [DM]

They're ace. She's 12.

00:55:48 [Marthah]

This is.

00:55:51 [Marthah]

All right, so this is about 30 feet away from me, right? And.

00:55:52

Yes.

00:55:54 [Marthah]

It's the last one.

00:55:55 [DM]

The farthest the it's about 30 feet, Christians about 30 feet away from you. He's face to face with God when the.

00:56:00 [DM]

Other goblin is about 40 feet from you.

00:56:05 [Christian]

OK, decisions, decisions.

00:56:08 [Marthah]

I'm gonna go to the one that's 40 feet away. These are presumably the last two, right?

00:56:14

Maybe.

00:56:16 [Marthah]

OK, I'm going to run 40 feet to the further one and I'd like to roll it in an intimidation check.

00:56:24 [Marthah]

I want to scare the **** out of him and.

00:56:28 [Marthah]

Ask them what the **** they think they're doing.

00:56:31 [DM]

So you run up rolling intimidation check.

00:56:35 [Marthah]

Intimidation is what?

00:56:38 [DM]

**** being tested again.

00:56:40 [Marthah]

Charisma no, no.

00:56:42 [DM]

Probably not charisma.

00:56:43 [DM]

Price strength.

00:56:46 [Marthah]

That's an 8.

00:56:46 [Christian]

It is not charisma.

00:56:48 [DM]

Is it strength?

00:56:50 [Christian]

I mean, I mean, it's not strange, it's crazy.

00:56:52 [DM]

Is it? Is it Christmas?

00:56:53 [Marthah]

It is OK, so it's a 7 then.

00:56:56 [DM]

Plus you got charisma, fire or no, just 7.

00:56:59 [Marthah]

Yeah, alright.

00:56:59 [DM]

So you kind of your voice, your voice booms as you kind of like, interrogate him and he doesn't really say anything in reply.

00:57:00 [Christian]

Sorry, Marco.

00:57:07 [DM]

You didn't really succeed in intimidating him.

00:57:07 [Marthah]

OK, let's.

00:57:09 [Marthah]

Was that my?

00:57:10 [Marthah]

Action. Yeah. OK.

00:57:13 [DM]

Christian, your turn.

00:57:14 [Christian]

I like to give another try at stabbing this bench.

00:57:17 [DM]

Go right.

00:57:17 [DM]

Ahead.

00:57:19 [DM]

Step a few feet forward. Trust them again.

00:57:22 Speaker 3

13.

00:57:24 [DM]

How would you like to do this?

00:57:25 [Christian]

Just thrust A spear into the heart.

00:57:29 [DM]

So you you take, you hold your spear back, you take a long, deep breath as you focus and you thrust your spear through his chest and it goes clean through. He dies right on this.

00:57:42 [DM]

Now the goblin that Martha tried to intimidate.

00:57:44 [DM]

Well, as I'm actually impressed you didn't make the save to make the role to intimidate him because he was on the floor and he did full face for it first.

00:57:54 [DM]

He kind of like fumbles with his bow and tries to shoot you, and that misses your turn. Martha, you missed again.

00:58:03 [Marthah]

OK.

00:58:10 [Marthah]

Yeah. So I'm going to do the same thing. I'm gonna ******* scream in his ******* face again.

00:58:15 [DM]

All right, try again.

00:58:16 [Marthah]

Uh, that's on 17.

00:58:18 [DM]

Yeah, that succeeds. What do you want?

00:58:20 [DM]

To say to intimidate him.

00:58:23 [Marthah]

What the **** do you think you're doing, *****?

00:58:27 [DM]

So as you kind of like boom at him and yell at him, he's very much intimidated and he drops his bow and he seems to have.

00:58:34 [DM]

No more urge to fight. FYI, the combat is.

00:58:38 [DM]

Over.

00:58:39 [DM]

And he kind of stands there and he's kind of shaking. He looks like he's going to **** himself. He's a little afraid and he starts mumbling to himself. You can't really make out most of the words, but what you can hear is monster. Afraid he doesn't speak much of common, but that's about what you can hear from him.

00:58:39

You know.

00:58:58 [Marthah]

OK.

00:59:00 [DM]

Combat is over. Feel free to do whatever.

00:59:03 [Marthah]

Yeah, I want to do a perception test check.

00:59:06 [DM]

Uh, what do you want to perceive?

00:59:08 [Marthah]

I want to look for.

00:59:10 [Marthah]

If not an actual monster, then signs of a monster or signs of a fight.

00:59:16 [DM]

OK. So as you're kind of looking around, you notice that you know the three goblin Archers that you thought were quite bloodied and quite.

00:59:24 [DM]

Up.

00:59:25 [DM]

The the the goblin that you, that Gore ******* crushed the skull in didn't appear to have any wounds on him. And the goblin that you stabbed in the shoulder, you end up finding a few feet later and he ended up dying as he tried to crawl away. He bled out.

00:59:43 [DM]

Because of the severe cold, other than that, you kind of see some dragging marks in the snow that lead into the direction that Gore went.

00:59:51 [DM]

And other than that, you don't really notice anything else of a fight.

00:59:54 [Christian]

I kind of I want to go to Lou just because she's presumably dead, but I just want to just see if she's actually dead.

01:00:02 [DM]

OK. So you kind of walk over and you like, poke him with a stick, like trying to feel his heartbeat and he's not alive.

01:00:10 [DM]

Both arrows cleanly went through his throat.

01:00:14 Speaker 3

We just knew we learned his name.

01:00:18 [DM]

So as.

01:00:18 [Marthah]

I'd like to Lulu.

01:00:20 [DM]

As as Christian pride to see if he's alive, your character, she drops to the floor on her knees and starts weeping and an absolute agony that their new friend Lewis died. And as you're kind of crying there, Martha kind of like sneaks **** and.

01:00:35 [DM]

Starts like feeling his pockets.

01:00:38 [DM]

Martha, Roll, roll perception to see if what you find.

01:00:41 [DM]

On his body.

01:00:42 [Marthah]

Oh, my God, that's in that one.

01:00:44 [DM]

That one. So as you're kind of fumbling.

01:00:49 [DM]

As you're kind of fumbling with.

01:00:53 [DM]

Thank you, Christian. I can see them.

01:00:55 [DM]

And they're kind of and they're kind of fumbling with his satchel. You, like, don't really find anything. Uh. You find, like, about 5 pieces of silver and you find a very crude map of where they're going, but it's now covered in blood.

01:01:13 [Christian]

OK.

01:01:16 [DM]

And so as you're doing this, Christian starts walking towards the direction of where Gore presumably ran off screaming war cries. Do you want to follow him or no?

01:01:27 [Marthah]

Yeah.

01:01:28 [DM]

OK, so as.

01:01:31 [DM]

One second actually.

01:01:35 [DM]

I'm. I'm gonna move Christian to a separate VC because he did get a head start on you. I'll be back in one second.

01:01:41 [Christian]

Bye, Martha.

01:01:41 Speaker 4

OK.

01:01:45 [DM]

So as Martha is kind of like fiddling through her pockets, you kind of like sneak away the best you can. Yeah. And you, you walk over to where Gore presumably ran away.

01:01:56 [DM]

And you see quite a greelish sight. You see Gore sitting in between 3 goblin corpses and one giant one looks almost like a great gorilla, right? White fur and its head is nearly torn off, and gore is sitting there, his arms.

01:02:16 [DM]

Leading one of his arms is dislocated. It's hanging by the blood vessel. It is just a gruesome sight. And he's sitting there.

01:02:23 [DM]

And just he.

01:02:25 [DM]

He looks like he could die at any minute.

01:02:28 [Christian]

Is.

01:02:29 [Christian]

So.

01:02:31 [Christian]

Is Marfa aware of this presence?

01:02:34 [DM]

You kind of got a head start. She can't really.

01:02:36 [Christian]

See you. She can't see me.

01:02:38 [DM]

She can't see you.

01:02:39 [DM]

I'm giving you the split second.

01:02:41 [Christian]

To react here, I am going to stab try to discreetly.

01:02:47 [Christian]

Vow it be an obvious try to kill Gore. I don't know how, but.

01:02:50 [DM]

All right. So you, you kind of walk, you kind of walk over and gore kind of stares at you and he sees you raise his raise, your your spear and he almost closes his eyes accepting that he would he would die in battle and you thrust your spear into his neck and he.

01:03:07 [Christian]

Let's go.

01:03:10 Speaker 3

Yeah.

01:03:11 [DM]

Welcome back, Martha.

01:03:12 [Marthah]

Thank you.

01:03:14 [DM]

So, Martha, as you're kind of walking towards where Christian was, you see Christians standing there and as you see Christians standing there, she's looking at this Gore site. You see three goblin corpses just kind of standing, like, laying on the ground, bloodied, ripped apart, and you see one.

01:03:33 [DM]

Giant like ape. What a huge gorilla with why?

01:03:37 [DM]

Fur and it is covered in blood and its head is nearly torn off as it starts to bleed through the mouth and in between all this chaos, you see Gore sitting down with his back against the dead monster corpse. He's covered in blood and wounds, scratches. You see his arms torn off.

01:03:57 [DM]

One of his arms is actually hanging by the blood vessel. You know, he he's looked like he died in a very gruesome but very honorable way.

01:04:09 [Marthah]

So who's ripped apart?

01:04:11

So.

01:04:11 [DM]

Everything there, the everything there, the gorilla 33, goblins and Gore gore kind of like is slumped in the middle of them after a victorious battle that he however died.

01:04:13 [Christian]

The gorilla, the Gorn?

01:04:26 [Marthah]

Oh my God. We picked the worst people to do this with Aaron Dill.

01:04:30 Speaker 2

You ******* kidding me? Killed the gorilla.

01:04:34 [Marthah]

Everybody's dead except for me and Aaron Dill. These people suck.

01:04:37 [Christian]

Are are we sure that like my my connection I'm trying to draw here is is, is this the gorilla that the monster that the goblins have? We're worried about? Like, is that some inference that can make?

01:04:50 [DM]

You can kind of tell that there are a few more corpses that you think that Gore could manage by himself.

01:04:59 [DM]

Like of goblin corpses, you kind of see like is you're more than than you think Gore could have killed you know what?

01:05:05 [DM]

I mean.

01:05:06 [DM]

So you think that this probably was the monster that they?

01:05:08 [DM]

Were referring to.

01:05:09 [Christian]

OK. Yeah. Just like the injuries on the goblins, like kind of like lineups like what?

01:05:13 [DM]

Yeah, they line up to Gorilla Brunt attacks and maybe the gorillas claws. You can kind of see that. You can kind of make a connection in your head.

01:05:22 [Marthah]

Are the injuries on Gore the same as the injuries on the gorilla?

01:05:27 [DM]

Walk over and roll a perception check on Gore.

01:05:32 [Marthah]

On gore lockdown.

01:05:35 Speaker 4

4.

01:05:36 [DM]

4.

01:05:36 [DM]

So as wow, that is real. Unfortunate. You could have found out something really important from.

01:05:41 [DM]

That.

01:05:42 [DM]

So as you kind of walk over to gore, you kind of like see that he has definitely some scratches from the gorilla and you see large bruises on his hand that's hanging from, like, the blood vessel is on the arm that's hanging from the blood vessel. And you can definitely tell that.

01:05:57 [DM]

The gorilla was definitely the one that.

01:05:59 [DM]

Kind of ended his heroic streak of beating the **** out of them.

01:06:04 [Marthah]

OK.

01:06:09 [Marthah]

OK, so I'm gonna look Gore.

01:06:13 [DM]

**** dude, you are ruthless. Well.

01:06:15 Speaker 4

Alright.

01:06:17 [Christian]

Hey, there's a difference. There's a difference between resourcefulness and ruthlessness. OK, come on.

01:06:17 [Marthah]

Money, man.

01:06:21 Speaker 2

Yeah, to work with you.

01:06:25 [Marthah]

With this guy, we went on one hike.

01:06:26 Speaker 2

Roll.

01:06:28 [Marthah]

Role investigation. OK, what's my? Oh my God, it's on that one.

01:06:35 [DM]

So you kind of fiddle through his belongings and you don't really find anything.

01:06:40 [Marthah]

Oh my goodness.

01:06:43 [DM]

It's almost like God.

01:06:44 [Marthah]

So I'm just going to tell Aaron to like, I guess this one's for you.

01:06:44 Speaker 4

And that doesn't want you to find anything.

01:06:49 [Christian]

What was it? Sorry I was writing.

01:06:51 [Marthah]

Something whatever he has on him.

01:06:53 [DM]

She tried to Luke Gordon, she seems.

01:06:56 Speaker 3

Oh.

01:06:56 [DM]

Incapable of searching his bottom.

01:06:58 [Christian]

I like to search your body.

01:07:02 [DM]

All right, go ahead.

01:07:04 [Christian]

What's this up?

01:07:04 [DM]

Roll investigation.

01:07:06 [Christian]

Investigation.

01:07:08 [DM]

Investment lization.

01:07:15 [Christian]

14.

01:07:16 [DM]

14 so as you're kind of like looking through his body, you don't find anything too particularly of interest. However, he is wearing a pendant of a cross.

01:07:26 [DM]

It seems to be made.

01:07:27 [Christian]

Of silver. Am I familiar with what this cross represents?

01:07:31 [DM]

Do a religion check.

01:07:33 [Christian]

**** wonder. Where's checks in the game?

01:07:38 [Christian]

Uh. Religions with plus intelligence 19.

01:07:42 [DM]

90 what? So you know exactly what this is. This is the pendant that the Cardinal Pope displays upon his Knights in one of the most populated.

01:07:43 [Marthah]

Nice.

01:07:54 [DM]

Of the two uh, what is it? Last passions of humanity that you know of, so it seems.

01:07:59 [Christian]

Wait, repeat, repeat. Can you repeat that again? Sorry.

01:08:01 [DM]

Yeah, so you know exactly what this is. This is the pendant that the Pope of one of the of the largest bastion of humanity, bestows upon his holy Knights.

01:08:11 [Christian]

Oh, he is a holy nugget.

01:08:13 [Christian]

Or presumably was a whole night if he didn't steal it.

01:08:16 [Marthah]

Where you killed one.

01:08:17 [DM]

It is difficult to get this pendant unless you are a holy knight or kill a holy night. That's all, Sir.

01:08:27 [Christian]

Just write something down here.

01:08:30 [DM]

You can, if it's an item that you're putting down, put Pope's holy pendant.

01:08:35 Speaker 2

Yeah.

01:08:43 [Christian]

I can. I can I?

01:08:47 [Christian]

Do I I want to put it on like just.

01:08:51 [DM]

Aren't aren't, so you you kind of like, take the pendant, examine it? You know exactly what it is. Do you want to tell Martha what? The pendant.

01:08:58 [DM]

Is or are.

01:08:58 [Christian]

Yeah, that's all right.

01:08:59 [DM]

You going to? OK, so you kind of like like you hold it up towards the sky. You kind of like explain.

01:09:06 [DM]

How big of a deal this pendant, like, actually is, meaning that, like Gore, was either like an incredible night in his heyday or like he killed a holy night and stole the pendant, both of which are quite impressive accomplishments, and you kind of put the pendant on do you want to, like, keep it shown?

01:09:24 [DM]

Or like hide it underneath your.

01:09:25 [Christian]

I'm gonna hide it on any.

01:09:26 [DM]

Of my shirt. So you kind of like, put it on. You slipped underneath her shirt and.

01:09:30 [DM]

You notice that it feels slightly warm.

01:09:36 [Christian]

I'll say I'll say I'll say this over shadow.

01:09:39 [Christian]

Yeah, even though it's kind of like a big deal having one of these pendants, I have to admit Gore was a I mean, he did. He did something here, but.

01:09:51 Speaker 2

I mean.

01:09:53 [Christian]

Like, but he's dead. So it's so like, what kind of?

01:10:00 [Christian]

Like what do you want to do from here?

01:10:03 [Marthah]

I mean, wait, you got here before me. Did you see, like, the end of the fight, was there, like, what happened before I got here?

01:10:10 [Christian]

No it.

01:10:10 Speaker 3

Was.

01:10:11 [Christian]

It was just this. As soon as I got here.

01:10:17 [Marthah]

OK.

01:10:17 [DM]

Christian, roll deception, please.

01:10:20 [Christian]

Damn you.

01:10:22 [DM]

I will not let this Slide 9. Roll deception, Martha.

01:10:27 [Christian]

Wait, let me check.

01:10:29 Speaker 4

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:10:31 [Christian]

Oh ****, NO55.

01:10:34 [DM]

Martha role in investigation. Check to see if he's lying or see if she's lying. ****, that's gonna be so hard. Dia used to I'm.

01:10:40 [DM]

Sorry, doing my best.

01:10:42 [Marthah]

Is that that's going to be.

01:10:43 [Marthah]

Wisdom.

01:10:45 [DM]

Yeah, probably.

01:10:46 [Marthah]

OK, well, perception it's a four.

01:10:51 [Christian]

That's cool. Wow, that's cool.

01:10:52 Speaker 2

Ohh.

01:10:53

So.

01:10:55 [Christian]

I'm a hunter apron, I swear.

01:10:56

So.

01:10:57 [DM]

To to your belief, you believe that she's telling the truth, that this was exactly how the scene was when you got here.

01:10:57 Speaker 3

22.

01:11:05 [Marthah]

OK. I guess I'll do a perception check and see if I can see signs of.

01:11:12 [Marthah]

Anyone or anything that I've might have left the scene, crime scene, scene of the crime.

01:11:18 [DM]

So you kind of like look around and due to the snow, you don't really see any footprints. You see some like you see the dragging marks that you saw earlier like kind of lead towards where the large gorilla was. It seemed to be his footprints, you know and like him.

01:11:34 [DM]

Dragging his foot.

01:11:36 [DM]

And to give you scale, this gorilla is like quite literally 8 feet tall. Like this is a large gorilla. And other than that, you don't notice anything different.

01:11:48 [Marthah]

OK.

01:11:51 [Marthah]

Well, erando.

01:11:55 [Marthah]

You seem like the kind of person that scares easy.

01:11:59 [Marthah]

Just based off of.

01:11:59 [Christian]

No ****. So I'm cutting up a dagger.

01:12:03 [Marthah]

So I guess I'll, I'll let it be your call. Do you want to continue on what we came here for or do you wanna turn back and see if maybe we can get our wits together and try again, maybe with some more competent people on at a later date?

01:12:18 [Christian]

I I'm not aware of like Silver shot having the the map or whatever it was right?

01:12:24 [DM]

No, you are not.

01:12:25 [Christian]

Yeah. So I'm OK. I'm pretty unsure of whatever we should continue because I don't have a reference of.

01:12:34 [Marthah]

I'll show you the map.

01:12:35 [DM]

So as you're kind of standing there pondering, Martha pulls out a map and a a very bloodied map at that, and then kind of shows you.

01:12:35 Speaker 4

Yeah.

01:12:44 [DM]

It's readable, it's soaked in blood, but it's readable.

01:12:50 [Christian]

What kind of information does this map display?

01:12:53 [DM]

The information is quite a crude map. It kind of shows like where you are starting, where you are continuing to like where your path was towards the end of the ravine, and then at the very end of it there's a small circle with an arrow.

01:13:06 [DM]

It's quite a crude map.

01:13:10 [Christian]

I honestly think we.

01:13:12 [Christian]

Just give it a shot and travel.

01:13:14 [Christian]

Onward.

01:13:16 [Christian]

I mean the monster the goblins were worried about is presumably dead right there.

01:13:21 [Christian]

The goblins are dead. We killed them.

01:13:24 [Marthah]

True. OK.

01:13:24 [Christian]

Gore killed him.

01:13:25 [Marthah]

Have you taken any damage? Are you hurt at?

01:13:28 [Marthah]

All.

01:13:29 [Christian]

I took.

01:13:29 [Marthah]

Do you solve the arrow in your leg?

01:13:30 [Christian]

I do still in fact, have the air on my. Yeah, true. OK.

01:13:33 [Marthah]

OK.

01:13:38 [Marthah]

All right. I would like to travel a little bit of ahead of Erindale. I still want to be in her line of sight. I want us to, like kind of stick together, but I want to kind of scout forward because I can be stealthy.

01:13:55 [DM]

How many feet?

01:13:56 [DM]

Of distance do you want from Arendelle?

01:14:00 [DM]

We talking 3040.

01:14:03 [Marthah]

Let's what's your speed 30, right?

01:14:08 [Christian]

9:30 yeah.

01:14:09 [Marthah]

OK, I'll say about 20, OK.

01:14:11 [DM]

So as you kind of continue on following the map N you kind of stay about 20 feet ahead of her and you guys are kind of walking, you know, and you don't really notice anything. You know, as you continue going on and you seem to be getting closer and closer like the walls are having are getting shorter and shorter.

01:14:31 [DM]

And it's maybe about.

01:14:33 [DM]

A 20.

01:14:34 [DM]

Feet.

01:14:35 [DM]

Distance between each of the walls now. So you're kind of getting closed in and you just kind of keep walking. The snow gets a little lighter, but it starts to get slightly darker. Please roll perception.

01:14:47 Speaker 4

Both of you.

01:14:50 [Marthah]

Jesus Christ 5.

01:14:52 Speaker 4

OK.

01:14:54 [Christian]

I can never remember what gets answered. Perception. It's wisdom, right 15.

01:14:57

Yep.

01:14:59 [DM]

15 so as you kind of keep walking forward, Martha, you don't really notice anything. And then, Christian, as you're walking 20 feet behind her, you also don't really notice anything out of the ordinary.

01:15:11 [Marthah]

Alright, well, I guess I'll just keep creeping up then.

01:15:14 [Christian]

I mean, why? Why change?

01:15:16 [DM]

Why change if it's working so Spencer, just send me a message, Spencer said. Are you terribly busy tonight?

01:15:27 [DM]

Doing in D&D what the home is.

01:15:31 [Christian]

******* nerd anyways.

01:15:34 [DM]

Anyways, so you guys keep walking and you slowly slowly kind.

01:15:38 [DM]

Of walk.

01:15:38 [DM]

And it starts to become maybe about.

01:15:42 [DM]

Like Martha can just barely fit through these walls as you're like kind of getting closer and closer, and you eventually reach a large stone door.

01:15:52 [Christian]

Open sesame.

01:15:54 [DM]

As you kind of stand there, Martha's ahead of you. You like, shut open sesame, and you're like, voice echoes through and nothing happens.

01:16:02 [Marthah]

I'm gonna give Erin Dilly dirty look.

01:16:05 [DM]

As you as you said as she says.

01:16:06 [DM]

That, you know, like standing there with her arms up, you kind of like, turn around and give, like, a scowl at her.

01:16:14 [Christian]

Can I closely investigate this door?

01:16:17 [DM]

Yeah. So you kind of walk up and you start like shoveling some snow off of it with your hands for months, snow drifts.

01:16:23 [Christian]

How big is the store?

01:16:25 [DM]

This door is roughly 20 feet tall. Maybe about.

01:16:30 [DM]

15 feet wide.

01:16:33 [DM]

Quite a quite a vast stone door, and as you're kind of investing in it, you know, you kind of see it has some old room shapes on on it and you can't kind of read any of it and you just know it's a large stone double door.

01:16:46 [Christian]

I can't read any of.

01:16:46 [DM]

The ruins. You can't read any of it.

01:16:50 [DM]

Either partly because you don't speak it, you can't read it, and due to age.

01:16:55 [DM]

You know.

01:16:56 [DM]

Kind of deteriorating.

01:16:57 [Christian]

Ohh I thought.

01:16:58 [Christian]

You talking about agent me? I was like, how old am I?

01:17:02 [Marthah]

You ******* old *****.

01:17:03 [DM]

Yeah. No, you are five years old and you haven't learned to read yet.

01:17:08 [DM]

You cannot read this date. This this door rather.

01:17:12 [Marthah]

I can I do the same?

01:17:15 Speaker 4

So sorry, I'm saying so. You kind of walk up.

01:17:20 [DM]

And you kind of get the same information there and they'll have. We both see a large stone door with a lot of runes or glyphs on.

01:17:27 Speaker 4

It.

01:17:28 [DM]

Can't really make out any of the information for at first glance.

01:17:35 [Marthah]

UM, is there a perimeter that I can walk around or is it just a stone door until like this side of the mountain?

01:17:42 [DM]

Just into the side, it's almost fit perfectly into lengthwise. I mean width wise.

01:17:47 [Marthah]

OK.

01:17:51 [DM]

Above the door is it's stone, as tall as you can find, as tall as you can see rather.

01:17:56 [Marthah]

OK, I'm.

01:17:57 [DM]

This looks very much like the end of the ravine.

01:18:00 [Marthah]

OK.

01:18:02 Speaker 3

We have.

01:18:02 [Marthah]

I.

01:18:03 [Christian]

You go.

01:18:05 [Marthah]

UM.

01:18:07 [Marthah]

Can I cast to conceal the party?

01:18:10 [DM]

Yes, of course you can.

01:18:14 Speaker 4

Uh.

01:18:16 [DM]

****. Remind me that, can you? I I don't have my notes open for that can.

01:18:20 [DM]

You remind me about that.

01:18:21 [Marthah]

I just have to succeed at.

01:18:22 [Marthah]

Dex check.

01:18:23 [DM]

OK, for yeah for both people.

01:18:24 [Marthah]

Right, yeah, for each.

01:18:26 [DM]

All right, so roll 2 D 20s for decks.

01:18:31 [Marthah]

One was a 14, one was 11.

01:18:34 [DM]

They both succeed. Don't worry. OK. So you you as you kind of stand there, you start like at at a very low whisper you start to say like some words that Christian you can't perfectly decipher and then all of a sudden a darkness kind of like envelops you and Martha.

01:18:51 [DM]

And you kind of, you kind of noticed that you're almost in like a haze now you can see everything clearly. But as you look down, your body seems almost like dismorphic almost as if it's fading like mist.

01:19:06 [Christian]

OK.

01:19:08 [Marthah]

OK. Are there can I check for any kind of mechanisms to open the door?

01:19:14 [DM]

Yeah, roll perception. I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick.

01:19:18 [Marthah]

Jesus Christ.

01:19:22 [Christian]

How's your rolls looking?

01:19:24 [Marthah]

It's a 5.

01:19:26 [Christian]

Ohh.

01:19:30 [Marthah]

At least that concealed us.

01:19:35 [Christian]

Right.

01:19:37 [Christian]

Kissing, gobbling stick, poking around.

01:20:01 [Marthah]

My rules have been so bad.

01:20:03 [Christian]

OK, OK. You're the one to talk.

01:20:07 [Marthah]

2 Nat ones.

01:20:09 [Christian]

Oh, never mind, I agree.

01:20:15 [Christian]

I think the lowest our old today is probably four or something like that.

01:20:21 [Christian]

No, not one.

01:20:27 Speaker 2

This is fun now.

01:20:28 Speaker 3

MHM.

01:20:36 [DM]

Alright, sorry about that. I'm.

01:20:37 [Christian]

Back, sorry, we we were plotting your demise, I mean.

01:20:40 [Christian]

What? Oh, that's fine.

01:20:42 [DM]

It's impossible anyways.

01:20:44

I rolled a.

01:20:44 [Marthah]

Five, please tell me I saw something.

01:20:47 [DM]

So you're as you're kind of like shifting through the door and kind of like moving some snow off of the walls. And the part of the door you don't really notice anything?

01:20:55 [Christian]

I like to.

01:20:56 [Christian]

Look for any mechanisms that this door may hold.

01:21:00 [Marthah]

Please roll perception.

01:21:06 [Christian]

Dirty 20, huh? Dirty 20.

01:21:09 [DM]

Wow. OK. So as you're looking around and you're kind of doing the same thing Martha did, following her footsteps and following where her hands were.

01:21:16 [DM]

Going.

01:21:17 [DM]

You look around for mechanisms to open the door and you find.

01:21:20 [DM]

Nothing.

01:21:24 [Christian]

I I I I'd like to turn around. Look at us over shadow and be like, yeah, you just have to jump up there and push that button that up there.

01:21:24 [Marthah]

Yes.

01:21:37 Speaker 3

Clearly lying, clearly lying, you're not even trying to trying to master, OK?

01:21:41 [Christian]

Exactly, yeah.

01:21:43 [Marthah]

Alright, I'm gonna show him how high I can jump.

01:21:47 [Christian]

Oh ****.

01:21:48 [DM]

Alright, roll roll dexterity please.

01:21:50 [Christian]

We're about to have a Jenkin.

01:21:51 [Marthah]

22.

01:21:51 [DM]

Contest 20. **** 22. Alright, so almost in your mocking tone. Martha goes. Yeah. ******* watch this and she jumps in the air and tries to touch to the top like as high as she can on the door and she touches like the top of the 20 foot tall door.

01:22:08 [DM]

And the door slowly swings on.

01:22:11 Speaker 3

What? What, what?

01:22:15 [Christian]

Job, Martha. I'm proud of you. I planned that I knew it.

01:22:22 Speaker 2

As the door swings.

01:22:23 [DM]

Open. You hear a like a loud like.

01:22:27 [DM]

A loud ambience of stone, like grazing against stone as the doors, the double doors slowly open inwards and you can smell like must and.

01:22:39 [DM]

You can smell that this.

01:22:41 [DM]

Door hasn't been opened in ages. You can see cobwebs, you know, it just smells horrendous.

01:22:46 [Christian]

Do we have it? Is it bright in there or?

01:22:49 [DM]

It is pitch black.

01:22:51 [Christian]

Do we have any sources of light that we could potentially here?

01:22:55 [Christian]

Because I don't.

01:22:56 [DM]

Uh, I don't think either of you have something in your inventory.

01:23:00 [DM]

However, if you paid attention, there was one source of light.

01:23:06 [Christian]

Well, I certainly did not do that.

01:23:08 [Marthah]

I also did not.

01:23:09 [DM]

Hint hint Loo had a torch on his belt.

01:23:14 Speaker 3

Back to luico.

01:23:16 [DM]

You want to go back to Lou?

01:23:19 [Christian]

I mean.

01:23:21 [Christian]

It's pitch black in there. Why the hell are we going there when it's pitch black?

01:23:24 [DM]

It is pitch black.

01:23:27 [Marthah]

Yeah, I guess we got to go back to Lou.

01:23:29 [DM]

All right. So as you kind of journey back to Lou to get to his corpse, you see, you see the torch and it's just kind of sitting there.

01:23:37 [Christian]

I'd like to pick up the torch.

01:23:39 [DM]

Right. So you pick up the torch and as you kind of are both, I'm presuming you're going.

01:23:43 [DM]

To walk back.

01:23:44 [DM]

Yeah, as you're both as as you're both walking back, it's starting to get darker and darker outside the white Sheen from the sun hitting the clouds in the snow is slowly getting darker and darker, and you eventually reach.

01:23:57 [DM]

Back towards the towards where you were before, where the door was.

01:24:02 [Marthah]

Is there somewhere that we can go just to like camp for the night?

01:24:05 [DM]

Looking around you where?

01:24:07 [DM]

You've walked back and forth. You don't really see anywhere else. The only possible camp area would be where you originally started like, way, way far back, couple hours journey and by then it would already.

01:24:17 [Marthah]

Be night. Yeah. OK, let's go on in then.

01:24:21 [Christian]

Onwards.

01:24:22 [Marthah]

And we're still concealed, correct?

01:24:25 [DM]

At this time, conceal is kind of worn off because you kind of walked back to get to Lou.

01:24:30 [DM]

OK, so if you wanted to do it again.

01:24:32 [DM]

You'd have to cast it again.

01:24:36 [Marthah]

But I can't do that until long rest, right?

01:24:38 [DM]

Yeah, I'm pretty sure yours is like one, Staley, right?

01:24:39 Speaker 3

OK.

01:24:42 [Marthah]

I think so, yeah.

01:24:45 [Marthah]

OK.

01:24:46 [DM]

OK, so as you guys kind of walk through the door, uh Christian, your character kind of like grazes the torch at the edge of the stone and it lights a flame.

01:24:58 [DM]

And you two continue through the door and you see a large set of staircase.

01:25:02 [Christian]

And we're sticking close because we need this one torch for light.

01:25:02 [DM]

That leads down.

01:25:05 [DM]

Yeah, yeah, it's quite dark. You're sticking quite close. OK. And you see a large staircase, a large stone staircase that leads into the depths.

01:25:16 [Christian]

It's just a stone staircase.

01:25:18 [DM]

It's a large stone staircase. You see nothing else past the door.

01:25:22 [Christian]

Down the stairs or up the stairs I.

01:25:24 [DM]

Don't know it's down. It descends.

01:25:26

Yeah.

01:25:27 [Marthah]

All right, we're going.

01:25:28 [Christian]

Down, down the stairs, we.

01:25:29 [DM]

Go. All right, so walking.

01:25:31 [Christian]

Slowly but surely, carefully.

01:25:33 [Christian]

Cause.

01:25:33 [DM]

Yeah. Yeah. Walking side by side. You kind of take one step at a time, kind of slowly but surely walking down the stairs.

01:25:40 [DM]

And as you finally make it down the edge of the end of the stairs, you're met with a large, vast opening at the end of the staircase, past past the staircase, you see two corners at the end of the stairs, and there's a large square room ahead of you.

01:25:56 [DM]

And you see what almost looks like a large dining room.

01:26:00 [DM]

You know it's it looks almost like a ballroom. Everything is covered in cobwebs and you see skeletons sitting at the table, their heads kind of like leaning against the ground.

01:26:06

Duration.

01:26:10 [Marthah]

I'm going to ask Arundel if she'd like to dance.

01:26:16 [Christian]

I mean.

01:26:19 Speaker 3

Sure, Mazing, is this an intimidation check?

01:26:20 Speaker 2

Menacingly, thou wants to dance. Hold dagger.

01:26:31 [Marthah]

Anyway, I'm just kidding.

01:26:32 [Christian]

Do I recognize like the architecture of these ruins, like of like what origin it could possibly be?

01:26:40 [DM]

Make a history check, please. History.

01:26:46 [Christian]

And history.

01:26:48 [Christian]

What's history under?

01:26:52 [Christian]

What is sister under Danny?

01:26:54 [Christian]

Ohh well intelligence Congrats 15.

01:27:00 [DM]

Aren't you the studious little?

01:27:02 [Christian]

Goober, I am.

01:27:04 [DM]

As you're standing there, you kind of walk. You're kind of like wafting the torch ahead of you.

01:27:09 [DM]

When you start to walk forward and you, you know that this is presumably the same architecture and style of the area that you are in.

01:27:18 [DM]

And it is the presumably from the books you've read.

01:27:22 [DM]

The same architecture and same furnishing as the Old Kingdom of the Desolated King.

01:27:29 [DM]

So is the mountain is named after prior.

01:27:29

Which?

01:27:34 [Christian]

Do I know? Like what? Like like time period in which this?

01:27:39 [DM]

You know it's, you know, it's at least it's definitely 100 years older.

01:27:44 [Christian]

And that's around the events of the downfall.

01:27:47 [DM]

Yep, 100 years was the downfall 100 years ago.

01:27:52 [Christian]

Are we saying exactly 100 years because the first time we?

01:27:55 [DM]

Exactly on the dot from now 100.

01:27:57 [DM]

Years ago, OK.

01:28:01 [DM]

You know this is at.

01:28:02 [DM]

Least 100 years old at least, OK.

01:28:07 [Christian]

I can relay this information to silver shadow.

01:28:10 [DM]

So as you're relaying this information to Silver shadow, you kind of you're both standing there and.

01:28:16 [DM]

As you're kind of telling her what the information is that you know, she kind of nods her head understanding and you see all the torches at the top of the.

01:28:24 [DM]

At the top of the dining room, start to light up 1 by 1 by 1 by 1, encircling the dining room, and then as where the staircases, the staircase where you came down from a large stone wall slowly and surely closes down, blocking you in.

01:28:40 [Christian]

Is there any kind of syrup per second high behind?

01:28:44 [DM]

As you're as you're looking around, kind of making a quick decision, you're looking around and you don't really see any surface you could easily hide behind you see a few stone marble pillars that are kind of go to the ceiling that you could presumably hide it behind, but other than that you don't see.

01:28:57 Speaker 3

Yeah, I'll do.

01:28:59 [Christian]

Anything else do that.

01:29:01 [DM]

OK. So as you kind of see that you're do you want to still hold the torch?

01:29:06 [Christian]

I'd like to quickly hand it to.

01:29:12 [DM]

As as you kind of are noticing, things are starting to unfold in an unsavory, savory manner. You kind of like tossed the torch up in the air, and Martha catches it, and you kind of scary being hide behind a.

01:29:23 [DM]

A marble pillar. Is there anything you want to do, Martha?

01:29:27 [Marthah]

Yeah, I'm gonna put the torch out, and I don't know, shove it in my pack and then I'll just uh.

01:29:34 [Marthah]

Look around and see if I see.

01:29:41 [Marthah]

Any living beings that are maybe, uh.

01:29:46 [Marthah]

Here to welcome us into their home, provide us with dinner and a meal.

01:29:50 [DM]

Balls.

01:29:51 [DM]

I like it so as you kind of stand there, you kind of thrust the torch into the ground, putting it out and you flip it over and it lands in your in your pack and you stand there valiantly as as a Aaron Dell kind of hides behind the.

01:30:04 [DM]

The pillar and as the torches finished lighting up, you ended up making it before the torches lit up. You see the skeletons at the three dinner dinner tables like slowly raise their heads as they begin to stand up.

01:30:20 [DM]

Role initiative.

01:30:24 [Marthah]

15.

01:30:25 [Christian]

Including me.

01:30:27

Yep.

01:30:29 [DM]

Actually no.

01:30:30 [DM]

No, he's hidden. They won't see you. The skeletons aren't intelligent. They won't see you. You don't need to roll in the stove.

01:30:30 [Marthah]

He didn't.

01:30:35 [Christian]

Good choice, cause I already did roll.

01:30:38 [DM]

They won't. They they won't. They won't see.

01:30:40 [Christian]

You good choice.

01:30:41 [Marthah]

Save it. No, I'm just.

01:30:42 [Christian]

Kidding. Am I keeping this? Am I keeping this number?

01:30:43

Well.

01:30:46 [DM]

No, you're not.

01:30:46 [Marthah]

No, you don't have to.

01:30:47 [Christian]

It's a it's a one.

01:30:50 [Marthah]

You got your first that one it.

01:30:51 [Marthah]

Doesn't even count.

01:30:53 [DM]

All right, Martha, what was your initiative?

01:30:55 [Marthah]

15.

01:30:56 Speaker 4

OK.

01:30:59 [DM]

One second.

01:31:01 [DM]

01:31:14 [DM]

No, they are not ten.

01:31:19 [Christian]

Death.

01:31:21 Speaker 4

Correct. Let's go.

01:31:26 [Christian]

I used that from Martha.

01:31:29 [Marthah]

Yeah, you're just gonna watch literally everybody in your party die.

01:31:34 [Christian]

I've watched them.

01:31:34 [Marthah]

All die. You better *** over my.

01:31:34 Speaker 4

01:31:36 [Marthah]

01:31:37 [Christian]

I've watched them all die in front.

01:31:38 [Christian]

Of me.

01:31:44 [DM]

I don't understand why people keep messaging me trying to roll 15 D 20s, right?

01:31:49 Speaker 3

Now and it's 1515.

01:31:52 [DM]

I mean what where? How, how?

01:31:56 [DM]

Why? Alright. So as you kind of are as Martha is standing there and Christian, you're hiding behind the pillar. You see 15 skeletons slowly start to raise from the table as they push back the chairs and.

01:32:10 [DM]

Two of them begin like kind of hobble, stepping towards you, Martha. It's your.

01:32:14 [Christian]

I like to step out.

01:32:16 [DM]

Alright.

01:32:16 [Christian]

And scream and scream. Yep, push your ******* chairs in, you uncultured skeletons.

01:32:21

Frame.

01:32:24 [Marthah]

Uncultured swine.

01:32:26 Speaker 4

As you as.

01:32:27 [DM]

You kind of like pop behind the pillar. You kind of scream. Scream that in every all of the skeletons instantly whip their heads and walk their eyes on you rolling.

01:32:38 [Christian]

14.

01:32:39 [DM]

14.

01:32:41 [Christian]

Hey, it's important, OK?

01:32:42 [DM]

Yes. I mean, hey, you're right after Martha.

01:32:45 [DM]

Martha trouton.

01:32:46 [Marthah]

Alright, so where's the closest one to me?

01:32:48 [DM]

They're kind of hobble, stepping towards you. They're about you can see the mass of them, kind of all walking towards you, like you can almost, almost as a wall of 15 of them are walking towards you. They're about 40 feet away.

01:33:02 [Marthah]

OK. UM, I would.

01:33:06 [Marthah]

How far is my jump?

01:33:09 [Christian]

I seen 10 feet.

01:33:10 [DM]

Yeah, probably 10 feet for sure.

01:33:14 [DM]

Because with the 22 you jump 20 feet.

01:33:17 [DM]

Because you did the cool thing and that.

01:33:19 [DM]

Was really cool.

01:33:20 Speaker 2

Yeah, it was really cool.

01:33:21 [DM]

So probably like 10, probably 10. I'll give you 10 feet.

01:33:24 [Marthah]

OK.

01:33:26 [Christian]

I'll look it up briefly, but you can keep it down.

01:33:31 [Marthah]

All right. I would like to run towards them, jump over them and get behind them.

01:33:37 [DM]

It's doable. Rolling acrobatics, check. It's doable.

01:33:39 [Marthah]

OK.

01:33:44 [Marthah]

22.

01:33:45 [DM]

Yeah, you definitely succeed. So you kind of like storm towards them and you jump over them and you land behind the wall of skeletons and they're all all of their eyes are still locked on.

01:33:56 [DM]

Arundel.

01:33:58

OK.

01:33:58 [DM]

Christian, it's your turn.

01:34:00 [Christian]

It doesn't look there's any rules official D&D rules about jumping like that.

01:34:04 [DM]

****. She gets 10 feet. Who cares?

01:34:06 [Christian]

Yeah. OK. I would like to approach the nearest skeleton to me.

01:34:12 [DM]

OK, so before you do that, it's it's a wall of skeletons, by the way. They're all kind of like standing next to each other.

01:34:22 [DM]

OK. Anyways, so you kind of walk towards the closest skeleton that kind of is maybe a foot or two ahead of the pack?

01:34:29 [DM]

And he's kind of hobbling towards you.

01:34:33 [Christian]

Her cousins.

01:34:33 [DM]

You look kind of right up in.

01:34:34 [DM]

His face.

01:34:35 [Christian]

Oh.

01:34:37 [Christian]

Act. Swing my spear.

01:34:38 [DM]

All right, so you swing your.

01:34:39 [Christian]

Spear rolled it. Or stylus? Yeah.

01:34:43 Speaker 3

No.

01:34:43 [Christian]

That must be a shame.

01:34:45 [DM]

You can swing a spear you can do.

01:34:47 [Christian]

Like a a cleave, you know, a cleave. Yeah. Uh, 2121. All right. Nice roll damage, please. Unnatural. Of course. Oh, that's fine.

01:34:58 [DM]

Can't get a can't get a Nat 20.

01:35:00 [Christian]

One anyways, ohh this is my first hit, I gotta speak.

01:35:03 Speaker 4

Yep. Congratulations buddy.

01:35:04 [Christian]

Man so.

01:35:09 [Christian]

****. What is that?

01:35:11 [Christian]

Oh 10.

01:35:14 [DM]

All right. So as you kind of you swing your spear like in an arc.

01:35:18 [DM]

And you end up taking out four skeletons and they all crumble into bones.

01:35:23 [Christian]

Nice.

01:35:27 [DM]

Now.

01:35:28 [DM]

Three other skeletons begin hobbling toward you. They're moving very slow.

01:35:33 [DM]

But they're slowly moving toward you.

01:35:35 [DM]

Martha, churn.

01:35:38 [Marthah]

Wait, how many skeletons did he kill?

01:35:41 [Christian]

Hebrew.

01:35:41 [DM]

Knocked out three skeletons that kind of like fell into bones.

01:35:47 [DM]

And the rest of the skeletons are slowly converging around them.

01:35:52 [Marthah]

I would like to attack the closest one to me with my dagger.

01:35:55 [DM]

All right, go ahead. Roll damage. I mean, roll hit rather.

01:35:58 [Marthah]

Not damage 23.

01:36:01 [DM]

23 hits roll damage, please.

01:36:04 [Marthah]

6.

01:36:05 [DM]

Six. So you kind of like swing your dagger and you kind of like slightly take off an arm of the skeleton and then you kind of slice again to the left and cut off the skeleton's head, and he crumbled into bones.

01:36:18 [DM]

Christian.

01:36:22 [Christian]

How? How far? Like it's a wall skeleton. So I'm assuming the next ones are.

01:36:26 [Christian]

Like.

01:36:26 [DM]

Still near me, most of them are kind of encircling you now. They're kind of walking towards you.

01:36:32 [DM]

Almost in 1/2 circle kind of trying to surround you.

01:36:37 [Christian]

Just try to like tackle like near the ends of like the half circle.

01:36:41 [DM]

Yeah, go ahead.

01:36:43 [Christian]

Whatever sculpting you want, I don't care. Yep. One of the ends at least.

01:36:48 [DM]

Sex. Sex so.

01:36:51 [DM]

You kind of like. So do you wanna, like do you wanna like arc or do you wanna?

01:36:54 [DM]

Like stab, how you doing this stab?

01:36:57 [DM]

Stab. So you kind of like stab one skeleton and actually cracks his rib cage and he falls to pieces.

01:37:04 [DM]

And as you do that, you see you see the more of the skeletons kind of hobbling towards you and I?

01:37:11 [Christian]

How far away are these skeletons for me? The rest of the ones assuming the one?

01:37:16 [DM]

The rest of the ones are about 10 feet.

01:37:18 [Christian]

From you with that.

01:37:20 [Christian]

Oh, shoot, that's not what an opportunity attack range is.

01:37:23 [DM]

It it is.

01:37:24 [Christian]

Not I would like to back away.

01:37:27 [DM]

You start to you back away. I'm a fart.

01:37:28 [Christian]

Do you wanna back away 15 feet?

01:37:32 [DM]

15 So you back up 15 feet after you took down that one skeleton, and the skeletons are still hobbling very slowly towards you, and now you see about.

01:37:41 [DM]

Six skeleton corpses slowly starting to converge together as the bones roll down onto the concrete.

01:37:50 [DM]

Martha, it's your turn.

01:37:52 [Marthah]

I want to go to the six that are converging.

01:37:56 [DM]

So you kind of like walk over and you see some you see the bones rolling together as they're starting to converge onto the ground, all the bones are making a pile.

01:38:06 [Marthah]

UM.

01:38:13 [Marthah]

Can I can I fight the the pile that is trying to become one?

01:38:20 [DM]

Do you want to like stab it with your dagger? Like, what do you want to do?

01:38:23 [Marthah]

I mean, I feel like that's the only thing I can do, right?

01:38:24 Speaker 4

It's.

01:38:24 Speaker 4

A. It's a pile.

01:38:25 [DM]

It's a pile of bones. You can do whatever you want, a pile of bones as of right now, they're. Yes, they're moving around quite suspiciously, but it's a definitely a pile of films.

01:38:33 [Christian]

Quite suspiciously.

01:38:36 Speaker 4

It's definitely a pile of bones.

01:38:41 [DM]

You can do whatever you want here, it's just a pile of.

01:38:44 [Christian]

Bones, can Martha and I have our six seconds of communication.

01:38:48 [DM]

Yeah, 100%.

01:38:53 [Marthah]

What's up?

01:38:53 [Christian]

Hey, silver. Shadow, can I have the torch?

01:38:59 [Marthah]

UM.

01:39:01 [Marthah]

Do you promise? Next time you're not going to hide?

01:39:03 [Christian]

I promise.

01:39:05 [Christian]

I'll be just as valiant as you next time.

01:39:09 [Marthah]

OK. Can I can I wear your pendant tomorrow?

01:39:12 Speaker 3

Sure. Anything for the damn torch.

01:39:14 Speaker 2

OK, I'll give you the first.

01:39:19 [Marthah]

All right, I give I give Arundel the pendant or the torch, I mean.

01:39:24 [DM]

So you kind of like lob as you walk over and you're looking at the bones, you kind of like lob the torch up in the air and Christian catches the torch.

01:39:33 [DM]

Is that all you want to do for your turn, Marco?

01:39:36 [Marthah]

Can I kick at the pile of bones that is moving suspiciously and try and scatter them?

01:39:40 [DM]

You use your action to you use your action to throw the torch to Aaron.

01:39:46 [Marthah]

OK. I'll just stand here and watch the bones.

01:39:48 [DM]

All right, stand there. Valiantly looking at the bones.

01:39:51 [Christian]

Trying to, I would like to strike the torch and try to set the pile of bones on fire.

01:39:52 [DM]

It's your turn.

01:39:59 [DM]

Do you? There's a wall of skeletons in between you and the pile of bones.

01:40:04 [Christian]

I would like.

01:40:04 [Marthah]

Hey Aaron. Now I think I'm going to.

01:40:06 [Marthah]

Need that torch.

01:40:09 Speaker 3

I like I.

01:40:10 [DM]

Probably asked what the battlefield looked like before you threw.

01:40:12 [Christian]

I would like to strike the torch and throw it silver shade.

01:40:20 Speaker 4

So you struck. You struck.

01:40:21 [Marthah]

We are so.

01:40:22 [Christian]

And then and and then say and then say you're not getting this damn pen cause you need.

01:40:27 [Christian]

This torch pen.

01:40:30 [DM]

So you strike the torch of the ground and the torch lights the flame and you throw it towards Martha and Martha catches it and that's your action. Do you want to move or?

01:40:38 [Christian]

I like to stare at the phones valiantly.

01:40:41 [DM]

So kind of like peering through two skeleton bodies, you stare at the at the bones, valiantly and after.

01:40:47 [Christian]

Sufficient.

01:40:49 [DM]

As you're staring, staring at the bones, the since you lit the torch on fire, the skeletons seemed to go into a frenzy and the skeletons begin to rush you, Christian. Ohh. And you are? You are quite literally surrounded by.

01:41:04 [DM]

9 skeletons as they rush you and they begin, they begin to attack you.

01:41:07 [Christian]

Nice.

01:41:11 Speaker 4

One second.

01:41:16 [Christian]

We're so efficient, Martha.

01:41:18 [Marthah]

Yeah, that was a good call, yeah.

01:41:22 [Christian]

Doesn't matter how things get done, it got done OK.

01:41:26 [DM]

So as the skeletons start to rush you, five of the skeletons end up tripping over themselves and falling into bones, and they start to converge into the pile and four more skeletons crowd you and start to hold your arms and your legs, and you are immobilized.

01:41:43 [DM]

Martha at your turn.

01:41:46 [Marthah]

I'm gonna stick the torch in the pile of bones in front of me.

01:41:49 [DM]

As you kind of see more bones and more bones kind of piling up towards you, you thrust this the torch into the pile of bones and you see the bones start to disperse and the bones start to converge onto the skeletons, where Christians are where Christian is.

01:42:05 [Christian]

And mobilize doesn't exist in D and D5.

01:42:07 [Christian]

E You mean grappling?

01:42:07 [DM]

It does not. Nope, it does not. You've been.

01:42:09 [DM]

A mobilized ****.

01:42:13 [Christian]

So does that mean restrained?

01:42:15 [DM]

You cannot move or make an action.

01:42:18 [Christian]

Man, he took that away in action too. That's.

01:42:21 Speaker 4

Yep.

01:42:24 [DM]

And so, Martha, as you thrust the.

01:42:27 [DM]

Torch into the pile of bones. They begin to disperse and they kind of start to move towards Christian. What do you want to do? You still have movement.

01:42:35 [Marthah]

I'm I'm getting over there with Christian.

01:42:38 [DM]

OK, so how close do you?

01:42:39 [DM]

Want to be?

01:42:41 [Marthah]

I would like us to be shoulder to shoulder cause are they're not circling him, right?

01:42:46 [DM]

They're holding his arm. They're they're holding her arms and legs.

01:42:50 [DM]

There are 4 skeletons and each one is holding a limb.

01:42:53 [Marthah]

OK, I would like to get in front of arrendale.

01:42:59

Hmm.

01:43:05 [Marthah]

Yeah, I guess I'll just be like, facing her, yeah.

01:43:06 [Christian]

In the front.

01:43:08 [DM]

OK. So as you kind of walk over and face Irondale holding the torch, the skeletons that are holding down Irondale see the torch and they start to rush you. They let go of Aaron Dale Christian Church.

01:43:20 [Christian]

I would like to.

01:43:23 [Christian]

Take an opportunity attack on them.

01:43:25 [DM]

Yep, Yep, you definitely have an.

01:43:26 [Christian]

Opportunity to attack. Yeah. Yeah. Give me that. OK. How many skeletons is it?

01:43:30 [DM]

All right, Ed.

01:43:33 [DM]

Therefore.

01:43:41 [DM]

They're all within the reaching range of you when they let go of you, you can hit all four of them with a.

01:43:46 [DM]

With kind of an architect 1818 that hits all of.

01:43:48

For what?

01:43:50 Speaker 4

Them. So you swing, you swing.

01:43:50 [Christian]

OK, one pack each.

01:43:53 [DM]

Yeah. No, that hits all of them. They're very brittle. You you kind of swing your your spear in an arc and you kind of like, cleave all four of them in half.

01:43:54 [Christian]

OK.

01:44:02 [DM]

And the bones fall down and the bones stop converging.

01:44:06 [DM]

That is the end of combat.

01:44:08 [Marthah]

Alright, I am putting the torch out.

01:44:11 Speaker 4

OK. So you you put the pork out?

01:44:12 [Christian]

No, not the damn torch.

01:44:15 [DM]

You put the torch up.

01:44:18 [Marthah]

OK. And I would like to pick up a bone.

01:44:21 [DM]

Alright, just pick up the bone.

01:44:24 [Marthah]

I I want to poke around Bill in the chest with it and then I'm just gonna do an investigation on it.

01:44:32 [Marthah]

OK, see if I see anything out of the ordinary.

01:44:35 [DM]

You start to investigate the bones and you notice that there are lots of ruins and magic circles on the bones.

01:44:42 [DM]

Almost engraved with like a knife into the bones.

01:44:47 [Christian]

Aye.

01:44:48 [Christian]

Would like to grab one and torches off the wall. If I can reach him.

01:44:52 [DM]

So you kind of walk over and you can't reach most of the torches, but you notice that one of the torches is like.

01:44:58 [DM]

Kind of leaning like where it would usually be mounted. It looks like it's leaning and it.

01:45:03 [DM]

Looks like it might fall.

01:45:05 [DM]

But it's about 20 feet in the air. You can't really reach it.

01:45:08 [DM]

It definitely looks unstable on the wall.

01:45:10 [Christian]

20 feet. Yeah, only I need someone who could jump 20 feet.

01:45:15 [Marthah]

Alright, I'll I'll jump for a torch.

01:45:15 [Christian]

Now.

01:45:21 [Marthah]

That's an 8.

01:45:23 [DM]

All right, so you kind of walk over and and you go to try to jump and you make it about 10 feet?

01:45:28 [DM]

In there, that's about it.

01:45:29 [Christian]

Alright, I would like to.

01:45:32 [Christian]

Try to throw my spear up there just to knock it down.

01:45:35 [DM]

All right, go ahead. Roll. Roll a D20 with your strength modifier.

01:45:43

12.

01:45:44 [Christian]

12 No 13, sorry.

01:45:44 [DM]

Of safety 13, that's good. 12 would have.

01:45:47 [DM]

Worked.

01:45:48 Speaker 4

So you you throw you.

01:45:49 [DM]

Throw your spear and you actually expertly hit the mount that the torch was on and your spear and the torch fall to the ground. The torch goes out.

01:45:57 [Christian]

Eyes.

01:45:59 [Christian]

And and the spirit came down.

01:46:00 [DM]

To you, right? Yep. They both came down.

01:46:02 [Christian]

OK, I like to grab.

01:46:05 [DM]

If you roll below an 8, your spear would have been stuck up there.

01:46:08 [Christian]

Oh yeah, and then we would need the jumping bandit over here too, yeah.

01:46:12 Speaker 2

We need to have Martha.

01:46:13 [DM]

Try over and over again.

01:46:17 [Christian]

It's like the time to save Scumming BG 3, just like trying to open that freaking door and.

01:46:20 [Christian]

That was all. Yep, Yep.

01:46:25 Speaker 3

Yeah.

01:46:25 [DM]

So yeah, you pick up, presuming you pick up the torch in your spear.

01:46:28 [Christian]

Is it what the torch?

01:46:29 [DM]

It went out when I.

01:46:30 [Christian]

Hit the ground. Ah, all right, room.

01:46:33 [Marthah]

I'm going to.

01:46:35 [Marthah]

Sorry, what?

01:46:37 [Christian]

What does this room like?

01:46:40 [Christian]

Surely we're we're on like the far end of the room now, right?

01:46:43 [DM]

Yeah, you're you're kind of towards the edge of the room now. You're closer to one of the walls, not where you're entered in.

01:46:48 [DM]

The stone stone wall that fell over the staircase is still there. The room is a large square room about maybe 25 feet tall, and it's quite it's quite vast, and you see all the torches lining the wall. One of them is missing since you took it and you see three dining tables and a chandelier. The tables are covered in cobwebs, and so is the chandelier.

01:47:09 [Christian]

Care for a dance?

01:47:12 [Marthah]

uh

01:47:16 [Marthah]

I hope you dance better than you fight.

01:47:18 [Christian]

Oh, I said. Ohh, come on. I thought. Wow.

01:47:22

I'm just kidding.

01:47:24 [DM]

To be fair, Aaron Dell did kind of destroy most of the skeletons.

01:47:28 [Marthah]

No, just kidding.

01:47:29 [DM]

Listen, Merrill, I'm looking at the battle log right now, and Arrendale probably took out fifteen of them at 15. I'm just kidding. Martha took out one.

01:47:34 Speaker 3

I I.

01:47:40 [Marthah]

OK, I'm gonna look on the floor to see if there are any.

01:47:46 [Marthah]

Like engraved symbols or anything in the in the floor.

01:47:52 [Marthah]

Like any.

01:47:52 [DM]

It's gonna. It's gonna take quite a bit. It's a big room.

01:47:56 [DM]

Is there anywhere specific you want to look?

01:47:58 [DM]

Or do you just want like everywhere?

01:47:58 [Marthah]

I was wanting to look like in the middle. Like is there?

01:48:01 [DM]

In the middle is kind of where the the dining tables are and the chandelier above it.

01:48:06 [Marthah]

OK.

01:48:10 [Christian]

Aye.

01:48:11 [DM]

For reference, you guys are on the West wall the where you entered is in the South. In the middle is where the is where the tables are.

01:48:18 [Christian]

Anything on north and East ones?

01:48:20 [DM]

At the north you see a small door on the east you see nothing.

01:48:20

Like you said.

01:48:26 [Marthah]

Alright, I'm going to go to the door.

01:48:29 [Christian]

To the door.

01:48:29 Speaker 4

You both you both want to go to the door.

01:48:31 [Christian]

Yeah, the door.

01:48:32 [DM]

Alright, you both walk over to the door and you see a very ornate marble door with a small handle.

01:48:41 [Christian]

OK, I don't. Oh, come on. I have some feeling that there's something extra in this room. I know there's something here.

01:48:48 [Christian]

So there's three dining.

01:48:51 [Christian]

Tables of a chandelier above him, right?

01:48:55 [Marthah]

I feel like this Chandler could be something.

01:48:55 [DM]

Danny. Really. Danny really liked puzzles. Danny really likes puzzles.

01:48:59 [Christian]

Yes, he really does love puzzles, and I know him very well.

01:49:03 [Christian]

There's something in this room. I just know it.

01:49:06 [Christian]

Yeah, but what?

01:49:09 [Christian]

Can I investigate underneath the tables seifers any like?

01:49:15 [DM]

So you look under the three you you look under the first table and under under the the marble table you see the number you see in grave you see the number 3.

01:49:15 [Christian]

Engravings in the.

01:49:16 [Christian]

Stone.

01:49:25 [Christian]

On the first table.

01:49:26 [DM]

In very large lines, under the first table you see like 3 lines engraved.

01:49:31 [Christian]

OK.

01:49:33 [DM]

You want to check the second table, yeah.

01:49:35 [DM]

Under the second table.

01:49:36 [DM]

You see a large one, just one tally engraved.

01:49:41 [DM]

Under the third table, you see two tallies engraved.

01:49:47 [Marthah]

OK.

01:49:49 [Marthah]

UM, can I look to see if there is anything interesting or special about the chandelier? Is it intentional like?

01:50:00 [Marthah]

In thirds or some form, something that would correlate to the number of tables.

01:50:06 [DM]

Looking at the chandelier, you see 6 candles on it on to on it.

01:50:12 [Marthah]

Are they placed in a way where it's like 2 over each table or?

01:50:17 [DM]

They're they're even. The chandelier is circular and.

01:50:19 [DM]

There are 6 candles on top of it.

01:50:21 [Marthah]

OK.

01:50:23 [Christian]

If we were to knock the chandelier down, where would it land?

01:50:28 [DM]

Directly on the tables. Yeah. Uh.

01:50:32 [Christian]

Do we have any kind of method? Again, this candles down.

01:50:35 Speaker 3

There.

01:50:37 [DM]

Their candles are a good 20 feet in the air. They're in line with the torches on the wall.

01:50:43 [Marthah]

I'm gonna jump. Can I climb on a table and?

01:50:45 [Marthah]

Jump you can try.

01:50:46 [Christian]

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:50:48 [Christian]

Wait, what do you mean they're in line with the torches on the wall?

01:50:51 [Marthah]

Same height.

01:50:52 Speaker 4

Yep, send.

01:50:53 [Christian]

Oh, oh, oh, hi. Oh, got.

01:50:55 [DM]

You same height. It's in the middle of the room same height as the torches on the wall there lit.

01:50:59 [Christian]

Gotcha. Alright.

01:51:05

Hey.

01:51:06 [Marthah]

So I'm going to climb on a table.

01:51:07 [Marthah]

And jump.

01:51:08 [DM]

Mark. So you climb on table, roll strength, Chuck.

01:51:12 [Marthah]

18.

01:51:14 [DM]

So you jump up and you make it to the chandelier and the chandelier is also made of marble. So you just kind of like touch it and you fall back down.

01:51:24 [Christian]

Can I?

01:51:25 [Marthah]

Like it knocks me back.

01:51:26 [DM]

Well, you kind of like jump up. You can't really hang on it. You know, you can't really pull it down. It's made of marble.

01:51:33 [DM]

So you can hang on it if you like, or you can kind of just fall back down.

01:51:33

No, it's.

01:51:40 [DM]

I presume you don't hang on it here.

01:51:40 [Christian]

Can I how how many torches, including the one that I have is there?

01:51:45 [DM]

Including the one that you have, there are 9 torches in the wall.

01:51:52 [Marthah]

369.

01:51:54 [Christian]

Did she find 9991 more time?

01:51:54 [DM]

Damn phone.

01:52:01 [DM]

Would you like me to relay everything you found in this room?

01:52:04 [Marthah]

Yeah.

01:52:05 [DM]

Under the table to the closest to the West, there are three lines engraved. The table in the middle there are one line engraved, the table farthest to the east. There are two lines engraved on the chandelier. In the top of the ceiling. In the middle of the room there are 6 candles.

01:52:21 [Christian]

Or.

01:52:22 [Christian]

6 Candles which is the total amount of towels underneath your tables.

01:52:27 [DM]

Around the room in torches, there are 9 torches, including the one Krishna is holding.

01:52:32 [Christian]

Which I don't believe.

01:52:32 [DM]

Meaning there are 8.

01:52:33 [DM]

Lit torches on the walls.

01:52:35 [Christian]

Which I don't believe there is any difference there.

01:52:38 [Marthah]

How many pillars are there?

01:52:41 [DM]

There are 6 pillars in the room.

01:52:45 [Marthah]

And are they along like the east and West, North and South?

01:52:51 [DM]

There are two pillars in the north.

01:52:54 [DM]

If you walked through them, you'd get to the door. There are two pillars in the South.

01:53:00 [DM]

And there are two pillars on either side of the staircase that you walked by that is now covered with the.

01:53:06 [Christian]

Door can I?

01:53:08 [Christian]

With permission.

01:53:09 Speaker 3

MHM.

01:53:10 [Christian]

Climb.

01:53:12 [Christian]

Silver shadow and somehow get to the chandelier.

01:53:17 [DM]

Standing on the table, if you climb silver shadow.

01:53:25 [DM]

If you stood on her head, you would be able to reach the chandelier with your hand on your tippy toe.

01:53:32 [Christian]

Would I be able to climb?

01:53:33 [Christian]

On the chandelier, you.

01:53:35 [DM]

You'd have to make an acrobatics check, yeah.

01:53:37 Speaker 3

Let's show it.

01:53:38 [Christian]

Do I have your permission? Silver show.

01:53:40 [Christian]

Can I climb you?

01:53:42 [Marthah]

Yeah, yeah, let's. Let's figure this thing out.

01:53:45 [DM]

You wish to ride me, Archer?

01:53:47 [Christian]

You wish to ride me in battle?

01:53:50 [Christian]

What a preposterous thoughts.

01:53:51 [DM]

Imagine if you were an Archer. You could, like, literally ride Martha.

01:53:54 Speaker 2

You could be one player, dude.

01:53:55 [Christian]

No, I could.

01:53:56 Speaker 3

Stab him with Spears.

01:54:00 Speaker 4

Like a ******* power rainbow, you know.

01:54:01 [Christian]

Let's let's say we can do that under the one condition that we have equivalent initiatives.

01:54:07 [DM]

I agree, I agree 100%. That'd be ******* hilarious.

01:54:09 [Marthah]

OK, I'm down. I'm down.

01:54:13 [Christian]

Alright, so acrobatics check, you said acrobatics. Check please.

01:54:20 [Christian]

I assume that's.

01:54:20 [Marthah]

Just for him or for me too? Do I need to do anything?

01:54:23 [DM]

No, you just kind of stand there valiantly.

01:54:26 Speaker 4

You don't really got to do anything.

01:54:27 [Christian]

I like how that's just the word that's describing more for these days.

01:54:30 [DM]

Valiantly, I mean if you want, you could hold on to his ankles her ankles.

01:54:37 [DM]

You know.

01:54:38 [DM]

Make her a little bit sturdy I guess.

01:54:41 [Christian]

I've got 7.

01:54:43 [DM]

Seven. So you can like kind of just barely reach it and your fingertips are touching it, but you're you're close, but you can't quite get a grasp.

01:54:52 [Christian]

Onto it. I wanna try again.

01:54:52 Speaker 4

Do.

01:54:53 Speaker 4

To climb up.

01:54:55 [DM]

All right, try again.

01:54:55 [Christian]

Real loudness.

01:54:57 [DM]

You can. You can try again.

01:55:01 [DM]

1313 all right, so you just managed to get your hand on the edge of it and you can kind of climb your way up it and.

01:55:07 [DM]

It starts to like slowly swing.

01:55:11 [DM]

Ever so slightly, but not really.

01:55:14 [Christian]

Can I grab the candles?

01:55:17 [DM]

The candles seem like they're kind of melted in place onto their each individual.

01:55:23 [DM]

Place on the chandelier are the candles lit?

01:55:26 [DM]

They are not.

01:55:30 [Marthah]

Can I pass the torch up to arrendale? Oh, you have it. Uh, try lighting him. Try lighting him.

01:55:32 [Christian]

I have. I have a choice.

01:55:37 [Christian]

I won't light the torch it, uh, the candles with the torch.

01:55:41 [DM]

So you kind of raise your torch up to the ceiling and graze it across the ceiling and the.

01:55:45 [DM]

Torch lights up.

01:55:46 [DM]

As you slowly begin to light each torch.

01:55:50 [Christian]

Each candle. Sorry my bad.

01:55:52 [DM]

Candle.

01:55:54 [DM]

As you slowly begin to light each candle, now all 6 candles on the chandelier are.

01:55:57 [Christian]

Light, nothing happens.

01:55:59 [DM]

Nothing has happened yet.

01:56:02 [Marthah]

OK, I'm just making shadow puppets on the wall while I'm waiting for Aaron Dill to finish.

01:56:07 [Marthah]

This.

01:56:08 [Christian]

I don't know what to do.

01:56:10 Speaker 4

You're close, you're close.

01:56:14 [Christian]

Aye.

01:56:16 [DM]

Puzzles have a lot of steps when you.

01:56:18 [DM]

Really think about it, yeah.

01:56:21 [Christian]

Can I take the candles down now that they've possibly warmed up a bit?

01:56:27 [DM]

They're warming up, but the candles are quite big and quite set in their place. They don't really look like they're meant to be.

01:56:32 [DM]

Moved or will be moved.

01:56:34 [Christian]

So.

01:56:35 [Marthah]

UM, maybe?

01:56:36 [Marthah]

If we look at the room from the top of the staircase.

01:56:40 [DM]

Staircase is blocked off, yeah.

01:56:44 [Christian]

Is it? Is this chandelier oriented in some kind of unusual way?

01:56:50 [Christian]

Like the way that the candles are being held, essentially.

01:56:53 [DM]

The candles on the chandelier are being held, Martha said earlier. They are evenly spaced around the circle of the chandelier.

01:56:57 [Marthah]

Evenly spaced in a circle, right?

01:57:02 [Christian]

But how? How would that correspond to the Italian marks on the freaking table since my?

01:57:10 [Christian]

So 3 marks under first.

01:57:11 [Marthah]

Are the tables round?

01:57:13 [DM]

The tables are rectangle.

01:57:15 [Marthah]

Rectangle. OK, so long tables. Are they arranged like in the cafeteria where it's just like.

01:57:23 [Marthah]

3 long tables all in a long row touching each other.

01:57:26 [DM]

They're arranged almost like.

01:57:29 [DM]

You would put 3 tally marks.

01:57:31 [DM]

There's spaces. There's two spaces.

01:57:33 [DM]

You know what I mean?

01:57:35 Speaker 4

I don't know if that's the best way to say. Yeah, you know, I'm trying.

01:57:36 [Marthah]

OK, OK.

01:57:38 [Marthah]

Yeah.

01:57:38 [DM]

To say yeah, like they're they're.

01:57:39 [Marthah]

Yeah.

01:57:40 [Marthah]

This.

01:57:41 [DM]

Long ways, the long ways they're facing.

01:57:44 [DM]

They're the like the each.

01:57:45 Speaker 4

Of the long ends of the table.

01:57:45 [Marthah]

Oh, why did it do that?

01:57:47 [DM]

Yeah. You're you're. Yeah. You know, I'm talking.

01:57:50 Speaker 4

Yep, OK, that's how they're spaced.

01:57:52 [Marthah]

Why does it show like that?

01:57:54 Speaker 4

If you if you.

01:57:54 [DM]

Think of it as eyes. The tables are kind of like this.

01:57:58 [DM]

Where the shorter ends are facing North and South.

01:58:01 [Marthah]

Oh, OK, OK, OK.

01:58:07 [DM]

Under the table to the farthest right, like toward towards the West, there are three tally marks. The table in the middle there is one tally, mark the table. To the West there are two tally marks.

01:58:20 [Christian]

OK, you just reversed it from what it was before.

01:58:23 Speaker 4

Did I?

01:58:23 [Christian]

Yeah, for sure, I'm pretty sure.

01:58:27 [DM]

Pretty sure.

01:58:29 [DM]

312.

01:58:31 [Christian]

From left to right.

01:58:35 [Christian]

From West, from West to east.

01:58:37 [DM]

West. East. Oh, you're right. Yes, I did reverse my bed.

01:58:40 [Marthah]

So is it West to east or east to West doesn't matter.

01:58:42 [DM]

I was right the first time I.

01:58:43 [DM]

Messed up my bed.

01:58:45 [Marthah]

OK.

01:58:46 [Christian]

And then you said there's two pillars like by the door, right? Yep.

01:58:53 [Christian]

And then 22 pillars in the middle, I assume of the room.

01:58:56 [Christian]

And then.

01:58:57 [Christian]

Two pillars by where we came in.

01:59:01 [Christian]

Like roughly like.

01:59:04 [Christian]

This.

01:59:11 [Christian]

Hold on.

01:59:13 [Christian]

Like this? I assume it's bought.

01:59:17 [DM]

Yeah, pretty close.

01:59:21 Speaker 4

Yep.

01:59:25 [Christian]

And it's the chandelier. I assume it's right above table of time mark one or the middle table.

01:59:32 [Christian]

How are the 9 torches?

01:59:35 [Christian]

Assuming that my torch is still there, how is that oriented around the room?

01:59:40 [DM]

The torches are not part of this puzzle.

01:59:45 [Christian]

Damn it, let me my freaking 9 torches.

01:59:49 [DM]

Don't worry about them.

01:59:50 [Christian]

I.

01:59:50 [DM]

The torches are abysmal to your goal here.

01:59:57 [Christian]

All right. Wait, wait, wait.

01:59:58 [Christian]

Wait, wait. Where is the markings of these tables? It's in the ground or.

02:00:02 [DM]

Underneath the table underneath, if you like crawled on the table and.

02:00:03 [Marthah]

Them.

02:00:06 Speaker 4

Looked up, looked up at the table, yes.

02:00:08 [Marthah]

Oh, at the bottom of the table, OK.

02:00:10 [Marthah]

Yep.

02:00:11 [Christian]

OK, so the markings are on the table.

02:00:14 Speaker 4

Yes.

02:00:15 [Christian]

OK.

02:00:16 [Christian]

So.

02:00:20 [Christian]

Can, with the help of Silver Shadow, can we move these tables?

02:00:25 [DM]

It will be labour some, but you can.

02:00:27 [Christian]

Can.

02:00:28 [Christian]

We like shift the middle table to the westmost and then switch.

02:00:37 [Marthah]

Oh, you want to put them in order?

02:00:38 [Christian]

Yeah.

02:00:40 [Marthah]

OK.

02:00:41 [Christian]

So from West to east, 1-2 and three.

02:00:44 [Marthah]

So we really just OK, yeah.

02:00:46 Speaker 2

You can do.

02:00:47 [DM]

That so as you kind of like slowly and move the tables and make grinding sounds as they kind of slowly move over.

02:00:56 [DM]

And you kind of you align them as 1-2 and three and as you align them the table like sink into the ground and the door at the end of.

02:01:04 [DM]

The Hall of the Dining Hall opens.

02:01:06 [Christian]

Oh, we didn't try opening the door so all this time I thought there's something extra.

02:01:11 Speaker 4

You did not try to open the door.

02:01:18 [Marthah]

It's just to open the door.

02:01:20 [DM]

No, you didn't even try the handle on the door.

02:01:24 [DM]

The door was locked and you didn't even try the handle.

02:01:27 [Marthah]

Alright, we're going through the door.

02:01:27 [Christian]

Can I can I give silver shower Hifi? Yeah, we are the most efficient there, aren't we?

02:01:34 [Marthah]

Yeah, you're so good at this.

02:01:36 [DM]

Edge you figured that puzzle up faster than I thought you would.

02:01:41 [DM]

Wasn't bad. You figured it out. That's.

02:01:42 [Christian]

All that matters I I I thought so. My original thought was like the candle was. You're supposed to, like, put the candles on top of the tables with respect him amount. So like.

02:01:52 [DM]

That's that's a good idea, though, smart.

02:01:53 [Marthah]

Yeah, that's kind of what I.

02:01:54 [Marthah]

Thought.

02:01:54 [Marthah]

Too.

02:01:54 [Christian]

3 candles on the table on the left. Nice one candle in the middle, 2 candles on the right. This one.

02:02:00 [DM]

The candles didn't need to be lit for the door opened as well. Yeah, that was.

02:02:04 [Marthah]

They did.

02:02:05 [DM]

Part of the puzzle.

02:02:06 [Christian]

Let's go. I knew that I knew that.

02:02:08 [DM]

You need. You needed to light all the candles and then the light and then move the tables in the correct order.

02:02:14 [DM]

If you didn't do both of them, the.

02:02:16 [DM]

Door wouldn't have opened.

02:02:18 [DM]

Hell yeah, onwards. I think this is funny though. You're like we we can't leave this room yet. We gotta figure out this puzzle.

02:02:26 Speaker 3

We just never try to open the door.

02:02:27 Speaker 4

Finishes puzzle door opens.

02:02:30 Speaker 4

Ship.

02:02:33 [DM]

And so you guys kind of move past the dining room and you go towards the door that is now open from your successful puzzle adventure and that's where today's session ends.

02:02:46 [Marthah]

Oh man.

02:02:49 [DM]

Hey, it was 2 hours, alright, good stuff.

02:02:50 [Marthah]

It's fun though.

02:02:54 [DM]

I hope you.

02:02:54 [Christian]

Hey, it could. It could have been five hours. That festival there. Let's just.

02:02:54 Speaker 4

Guys enjoy.

02:02:57 [DM]

Say that, yeah, the, the the puzzle was definitely there for some fun. There will be a lot of puzzles. I like puzzles.

02:02:58 [Marthah]

For real?

02:03:05 [Christian]

I went like right before we went to try the door. I just went. I know Danny. I know. I know how he operates. I know he has hidden secrets over it was if I bet there was a freaking secret in a freaking ravine and we missed it. OK, I guarantee you there was one. But you're correct. Yeah. OK.

02:03:10 Speaker 4

Like wait.

02:03:12 Speaker 2

Stop.

02:03:21 Speaker 4

You are.

02:03:24 [Christian]

Unfortunately, it's a bit late for that, but you.

02:03:27 [DM]

Know. I just. Yeah. You. Yeah. Yeah. You cannot really return to the ravine.

02:03:34 [DM]

If you wanna know what the secret in the vein was, I can tell you since there's.

02:03:36 [Christian]

No.

02:03:36 [DM]

Like virtually no way you can get back to it, no?

02:03:38 [Christian]

Now.

02:03:40 Speaker 3

All right.

02:03:41 [Christian]

No, I.

02:03:42 [Marthah]

What Christian secret?

02:03:44 [DM]

No, no. The secret at the end of the like the the ravine area that you were there, there's a secret.

02:03:51 [Christian]

There, there's a secret in the.

02:03:52 [DM]

That you messed.

02:03:55 [Marthah]

Oh no.

02:03:56 [DM]

And I was saying I could tell you what it is if you wanted to know, but Christian declined that information.

02:03:59 [Christian]

But do we really deserve to know? Do we deserve to know that?

02:04:03 [DM]

It was a little bit of a roundabout approach. What it was a little bit of a roundabout approach to get to it.

02:04:10 [DM]

It was definitely there in case you were creative.

02:04:14 [Marthah]

So Lou and.

02:04:15 [Marthah]

Gore were just always gonna die, right?

02:04:17 [DM]

Their death was inevitable, OK?

02:04:20 [DM]

They were, but merely sacrificial poems.

02:04:24 [Marthah]

Were you just waiting for me to talk to Lou before?

02:04:24 Speaker 4

In order to.

02:04:26 [Marthah]

You killed him off.

02:04:28 [DM]

Now he's going to die. Like after a certain point. OK, you just happened to be talking to him? Exactly in the point of time when he was dying.

02:04:36 [Christian]

And gorgeous dying off screen like what the ****?

02:04:36 Speaker 4

Did you just kind of sit there?

02:04:40 Speaker 4

Yeah, it's kind of ******.

02:04:41 Speaker 4

Up.

02:04:43 [DM]

I mean to be fair though, he did.

02:04:45 [DM]

He did kill a big *** monster, so.

02:04:48 [Christian]

He went out as meant. The word was said many times a day.

02:04:53 [Christian]

Valiantly valiantly.

02:04:54 [Marthah]

I wonder if he would have lived if he had a freakin.

02:04:58 [Marthah]

Weapon.

02:05:00 [DM]

No Gores specialty is hand to hand combat. He doesn't do weapons.

02:05:05 [Christian]

I'm just curious. She is one of the nights.

02:05:08 [DM]

I don't know. It could have been where he could have killed a night one or the other.

02:05:12 [Christian]

One or the other.

02:05:16 [Christian]

Hey, I'm going to stop.

02:05:16 [DM]

Yeah, does. Does anyone have any questions?

02:05:19 [Marthah]

No, that was fun.

02:05:21 [Christian]

Good. Well, fun. Good. I'm glad you enjoyed.

02:05:23 [Christian]

Care for a dance?

02:05:25 Speaker 4

Care for dance? I'll dance.

02:05:28 Speaker 3

It's it's, it's.

02:05:28 [DM]

So the total number of secrets you missed in today's session is?

02:05:32

5.

02:05:32 Speaker 4

22.

02:05:35 [Christian]

Damn, where was the second one?

02:05:37 [DM]

One was in the ravine.

02:05:41 [Marthah]

One was in the room.

02:05:45 [Marthah]

It had to have been with, like this skeletons.

02:05:46 [Christian]

He's not gonna tell us because we're still in the room.

02:05:48 [Christian]

So he can still technically do, yeah.

02:05:55 [Christian]

Yeah.

02:05:57 [DM]

Any questions? Any feedback?

02:06:00 [Christian]

Anyone.

02:06:00 [Marthah]

No, it was fun.

02:06:01 [DM]

Good, glad you enjoyed.

02:06:02 [Marthah]

When's the next one?

02:06:05 [DM]

We'll do one next weekend.

02:06:06 [Marthah]

OK.

02:06:08 [Christian]

We're doing it daily.

02:06:12 [DM]

I mean, I could probably I could probably do it by like every two days. Definitely do one.

02:06:17 [Christian]

Stable one every three days.

02:06:20 [DM]

Yeah, I could do that.

02:06:22 [DM]

I'm not going to but.

02:06:23 [DM]

I could could.

02:06:25 [DM]

It's doable but.

02:06:27 [Marthah]

It's also a lot of work.

02:06:27 Speaker 4

Yeah, we'll probably do it like.

02:06:30 [DM]

Every weekend, OK.

02:06:32 [Christian]

Do it like when you're ready. Cause I'm excited. Yep.

02:06:36 [Marthah]

Yeah.

02:06:37 [DM]

Well, I mean I'm. I'm prepared for the next 4 sessions all.

02:06:41 [Christian]

Right, let's do it now.

02:06:43 [Marthah]

Yeah, what the hell?

02:06:45 [DM]

No, I'm prepared for the next 4 shows sessions, but today is a Sunday, so we did on a Saturday. We would have gone for two or.

02:06:54 [DM]

Three hours more so.

02:06:54 Speaker 3

Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:06:58 [DM]

But today was just kind of get your feet wet, get you interested?

02:07:02 [Christian]

It was a bit slow to start. I'm not gonna lie, but it's fair. Not not. Not like you, but like me trying to get into the.

02:07:11 [DM]

Getting swing.

02:07:12 [Christian]

Of it, yeah.

02:07:13 [DM]

That's fair.

02:07:14 [Marthah]

I still have no idea what I'm doing, but it's fun.

02:07:17 [Christian]

You're doing fine.

02:07:18 [DM]

You're doing good. You just kind of walk around. Think of it as a mystery, and like you just walk around and explore.

02:07:24 [Christian]

Market to experience the Indian the fundamental level where the first characters you meet will pretty much almost always die.

02:07:33 [DM]

And every D&D campaign I've ever done that they always die.

02:07:37 [Christian]

They always die. They're.

02:07:39 [Marthah]

I honestly.

02:07:39 Speaker 4

But mere sacrificial?

02:07:42 [Marthah]

I wasn't expecting Lou to die. I thought we were gonna get in there and he was gonna be like it was all like a ploy to.

02:07:50 [Christian]

To plunder, yeah.

02:07:50 [Marthah]

He wanted to use us to get the ****, yeah.

02:07:55 [Christian]

Stop giving him ideas, Martha.

02:07:57 [Marthah]

Yeah, right. My bad.

02:07:58 [DM]

You'll keep taking notes, actively keep giving me ideas. What's the worst thing that could happen in your campaign that you absolutely hate?

02:08:06 [Christian]

Your campaign, OK, a lot with you because you do not go like, should I do this? You go.

02:08:18 Speaker 4

Yes, Sir.

02:08:23 [DM]

I enjoy watching you suffer.

02:08:26 [Marthah]

Rude, but OK.

02:08:28 [DM]

It's fun if you ever deal, Martha. You'll understand. It's fun.

02:08:32 [DM]

He's right. You stand there and you like you go. They say. I think I'll do this. And you're like.

02:08:39 [DM]

You don't say anything, you just stay silent.

02:08:42 [DM]

And then they take your silence as like being afraid, and then they don't do it and they end up ******* them over. Or they do do it and it ***** them over.

02:08:50 [Christian]

I remember making you scared.

02:08:52 [DM]

Yeah, every deal makes me scared. I make every.

02:08:53 [Christian]

No, no, no, no.

02:08:54 Speaker 2

No scarce.

02:08:55 [Christian]

Player skin. Remember the the start of my shader viral campaign where it was just like that strange weird anomaly event that was happening at marianapolis and everyone was staring up at you.

02:09:07 Speaker 4

Yeah, I was a little. I was a little confused.

02:09:10 [DM]

I was definitely confused.

02:09:11 [Christian]

Zach said he's freaking terrified. I mean, but that's Zach, so.

02:09:15 [DM]

Zach is terrified of bugs.

02:09:17 [Christian]

True.

02:09:19 [DM]

But yeah, no, I was. I was definitely on the edge of my seat trying.

02:09:22 [Christian]

To figure out what was going on. Yeah, and that that. I mean, it was intentionally.

02:09:26 [Christian]

Vague and.

02:09:27 Speaker 4

Yeah, Yep. Yeah.

02:09:33 [Christian]

But Martha.

02:09:38 [Christian]

Hi.

02:09:38

What? Hi.

02:09:41 [Christian]

I have no secrets.

02:09:45 [Christian]

Totally not one.

02:09:48 [Marthah]

OK, my mom's calling me, so I gotta go.

02:09:51 [Marthah]

Bye bye bye.
